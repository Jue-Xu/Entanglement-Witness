  abstract = {BosonSampling, which we proposed three years ago, is a scheme for using linear-optical networks to solve sampling problems that appear to be intractable for a classical computer. In arXiv:1306.3995, Gogolin et al. claimed that even an ideal BosonSampling device's output would be "operationally indistinguishable" from a uniform random outcome, at least "without detailed a priori knowledge"; or at any rate, that telling the two apart might itself be a hard problem. We first answer these claims---explaining why the first is based on a definition of "a priori knowledge" so strange that, were it adopted, almost no quantum algorithm could be distinguished from a pure random-number source; while the second is neither new nor a practical obstacle to interesting BosonSampling experiments. However, we then go further, and address some interesting research questions inspired by Gogolin et al.'s mistaken arguments. We prove that, with high probability over a Haar-random matrix A, the BosonSampling distribution induced by A is far from the uniform distribution in total variation distance. More surprisingly, and directly counter to Gogolin et al., we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes these two distributions with constant bias. Finally, we offer three "bonus" results about BosonSampling. First, we report an observation of Fernando Brandao: that one can efficiently sample a distribution that has large entropy and that's indistinguishable from a BosonSampling distribution by any circuit of fixed polynomial size. Second, we show that BosonSampling distributions can be efficiently distinguished from uniform even with photon losses and for general initial states. Third, we offer the simplest known proof that FermionSampling is solvable in classical polynomial time, and we reuse techniques from our BosonSampling analysis to characterize random FermionSampling distributions.},

  abstract = {In the near future, there will likely be special-purpose quantum computers with 40-50 high-quality qubits. This paper lays general theoretical foundations for how to use such devices to demonstrate "quantum supremacy": that is, a clear quantum speedup for some task, motivated by the goal of overturning the Extended Church-Turing Thesis as confidently as possible. First, we study the hardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along the lines of a recent proposal by the the Quantum AI group at Google. We show that there's a natural hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with sampling, yet implies that no efficient classical algorithm can pass a statistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass. Compared to previous work, the central advantage is that we can now talk directly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being sampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new algorithm, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates in polynomial space and m\^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known algorithms fail to refute our assumption. Third, resolving an open problem of Aaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem--of the form "if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then PH collapses"--must be non-relativizing. Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson and Ambainis, we show that the Fourier Sampling problem achieves a constant versus linear separation between quantum and randomized query complexities. Fifth, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly. Previous work implies that, if OWFs exist, then quantum supremacy is possible relative to such oracles. We show that some assumption is needed: if SampBPP=SampBQP and NP is in BPP, then quantum supremacy is impossible relative to such oracles.},

  abstract = {We give new evidence that quantum computers -- moreover, rudimentary quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements -- cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P\#P=BPPNP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation. Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture, which says that it is \#P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture, which says that |Per(A)|{$>$}={$\surd$}(n!)poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to theoretical computer scientists.},

  abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit -- that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates -- can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor-2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely-available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-Phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ParityL, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a "canonical form" that requires at most O(n\^2/log n) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of non-stabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.},

In this paper, we make two advances toward such a theorem, in the black-box model where most quantum algorithms operate. First, we show that for any problem that is invariant under permuting inputs and outputs (like the collision or the element distinctness problems), the quantum query complexity is at least the 7th root of the classical randomized query complexity. (An earlier version of this paper gave the 9th root.) This resolves a conjecture of Watrous from 2002. Second, inspired by recent work of O'Donnell et al. (2005) and Dinur et al. (2006), we conjecture that every bounded low-degree polynomial has a "highly influential" variable. Assuming this conjecture, we show that every T-query quantum algorithm can be simulated on most inputs by a poly(T)-query classical algorithm, and that one essentially cannot hope to prove P!=BQP relative to a random oracle.},

  abstract = {In this paper some theoretical and (potentially) practical aspects of quantum computing are considered. Using the tools of transcendental number theory it is demonstrated that quantum Turing machines (QTM) with rational amplitudes are sufficient to define the class of bounded error quantum polynomial time (BQP) introduced by Bernstein and Vazirani [Proc. 25th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computation, 1993, pp. 11--20, SIAM J. Comput., 26 (1997), pp. 1277--1339]. On the other hand, if quantum Turing machines are allowed unrestricted amplitudes (i.e., arbitrary complex amplitudes), then the corresponding BQP class has uncountable cardinality and contains sets of all Turing degrees. In contrast, allowing unrestricted amplitudes does not increase the power of computation for error-free quantum polynomial time (EQP). Moreover, with unrestricted amplitudes, BQP is not equal to EQP. The relationship between quantum complexity classes and classical complexity classes is also investigated. It is shown that when quantum Turing machines are restricted to have transition amplitudes which are algebraic numbers, BQP, EQP, and nondeterministic quantum polynomial time (NQP) are all contained in PP, hence in \$\{\textbackslash rm P\}\^\{\#\{\textbackslash rm P\}\}\$ and PSPACE. A potentially practical issue of designing "machine independent" quantum programs is also addressed. A single ("almost universal") quantum algorithm based on Shor's method for factoring integers is developed which would run correctly on almost all quantum computers, even if the underlying unitary transformations are unknown to the programmer and the device builder.}

In recent years, researchers in quantum computational complexity have tried to identify approaches and develop tools that address the question: does a quantum version of the PCP theorem hold? The story of this study starts with classical complexity and takes unexpected turns providing fascinating vistas on the foundations of quantum mechanics and multipartite entanglement, topology and the so-called phenomenon of topological order, quantum error correction, information theory, and much more; it raises questions that touch upon some of the most fundamental issues at the heart of our understanding of quantum mechanics. At this point, the jury is still out as to whether or not such a theorem holds.

We give definitions of mixing time, filling time, dispersion time. We show that in all these measures, the quantum walk on the cycle is almost quadratically faster then its classical correspondent.

This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer's Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: The system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima.},

This result for the first time exhibits a significant difference between discrete time and continuous time walks without coin degrees of freedom, since it has been shown recently that such a continuous time walk needs time \$\textbackslash Omega(N)\$ to perform the same task.

We generalize our result to 3 and more dimensions where the walk yields the optimal performance of \$O(\textbackslash sqrt\{N\})\$ and give several extensions of quantum walk search algorithms for general graphs. The coin-flip operation needs to be chosen judiciously: we show that another ``natural'' choice of coin gives a walk that takes \$\textbackslash Omega(N)\$ steps. We also show that in 2 dimensions it is sufficient to have a two-dimensional coin-space to achieve the time \$O(\textbackslash sqrt\{N\} \textbackslash log N)\$.},

Specifically, we show that for a chain of d-dimensional spins, governed by a 1D local Hamiltonian with a spectral gap \textbackslash eps{$>$}0, the entanglement entropy of the ground state with respect to any cut in the chain is upper bounded by \$O\{\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash log\^3 d\}\{\textbackslash eps\}\}\$. Our approach uses the framework Arad et al to construct a Chebyshev-based AGSP (Approximate Ground Space Projection) with favorable factors. However, our construction uses the Hamiltonian directly, instead of using the Detectability lemma, which allows us to work with general (frustrated) Hamiltonians, as well as slightly improving the \$1/\textbackslash eps\$ dependence of the bound in Arad et al. To achieve that, we establish a new, "random-walk like", bound on the entanglement rank of an arbitrary power of a 1D Hamiltonian, which might be of independent interest: \textbackslash ER\{H\^\textbackslash ell\} \textbackslash le (\textbackslash ell d)\^\{O(\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash ell\})\}. Finally, treating d as a constant, our AGSP shows that the ground state is well approximated by a matrix product state with a sublinear bond dimension \$B=e\^\{O(\textbackslash log\^\{3/4\}n/\textbackslash eps\^\{1/4\})\}. Using this in conjunction with known dynamical programing algorithms, yields an algorithm for a 1/\textbackslash poly(n) approximation of the ground energy with a subexponential running time T\textbackslash le \textbackslash exp(e\^\{O(\textbackslash log\^\{3/4\}n/\textbackslash eps\^\{1/4\})\}).},

  abstract = {One of the central challenges in the study of quantum many-body systems is the complexity of simulating them on a classical computer. A recent advance of Landau et al. gave a polynomial time algorithm to actually compute a succinct classical description for unique ground states of gapped 1D quantum systems. Despite this progress many questions remained unresolved, including whether there exist rigorous efficient algorithms when the ground space is degenerate (and poly(\$n\$) dimensional), or for the poly(\$n\$) lowest energy states for 1D systems, or even whether such states admit succinct classical descriptions or area laws. In this paper we give a new algorithm for finding low energy states for 1D systems, based on a rigorously justified RG type transformation. In the process we resolve some of the aforementioned open questions, including giving a polynomial time algorithm for poly(\$n\$) degenerate ground spaces and an \$n\^\{O(\textbackslash log n)\}\$ algorithm for the poly(\$n\$) lowest energy states for 1D systems (under a mild density condition). We note that for these classes of systems the existence of a succinct classical description and area laws were not rigorously proved before this work. The algorithms are natural and efficient, and for the case of finding unique ground states for frustration-free Hamiltonians the running time is \$\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(nM(n))\$, where \$M(n)\$ is the time required to multiply two \$n\textbackslash times n\$ matrices.},

The best previous bound for GI was \$\textbackslash exp(O(\textbackslash sqrt\{n\textbackslash log n\}))\$, where \$n\$ is the number of vertices (Luks, 1983); for the other two problems, the bound was similar, \$\textbackslash exp(\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}))\$, where \$n\$ is the size of the permutation domain (Babai, 1983). The algorithm builds on Luks's SI framework and attacks the barrier configurations for Luks's algorithm by group theoretic "local certificates" and combinatorial canonical partitioning techniques. We show that in a well-defined sense, Johnson graphs are the only obstructions to effective canonical partitioning. Luks's barrier situation is characterized by a homomorphism \{\textbackslash phi\} that maps a given permutation group \$G\$ onto \$S\_k\$ or \$A\_k\$, the symmetric or alternating group of degree \$k\$, where \$k\$ is not too small. We say that an element \$x\$ in the permutation domain on which \$G\$ acts is affected by \{\textbackslash phi\} if the \{\textbackslash phi\}-image of the stabilizer of \$x\$ does not contain \$A\_k\$. The affected/unaffected dichotomy underlies the core "local certificates" routine and is the central divide-and-conquer tool of the algorithm.},

We present the first application of a recently developed technique for simulating Hamiltonian evolution using a truncated Taylor series to obtain logarithmic scaling with the inverse of the desired precision, an exponential improvement over all prior methods. The two algorithms developed in this work rely on a second quantized encoding of the wavefunction in which the state of an \$N\$ spin-orbital system is encoded in \$\{\textbackslash cal O\}(N)\$ qubits. Our first algorithm requires at most \$\textbackslash widetilde\{\textbackslash cal O\}(N\^8 t)\$ gates. Our second algorithm involves on-the-fly computation of molecular integrals, in a way that is exponentially more precise than classical sampling methods, by using the truncated Taylor series simulation technique. Our second algorithm has the lowest gate count of any approach to second quantized quantum chemistry simulation in the literature, scaling as \$\textbackslash widetilde\{\textbackslash cal O\}(N\^\{5\} t)\$. The approaches presented here are readily applicable to a wide class of fermionic models, many of which are defined by simplified versions of the chemistry Hamiltonian.},

In quantum mechanics, the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence can be used to measure the dissimilarity of quantum systems specified in terms of their density matrices. We commence by computing the density matrix associated with a continuous-time quantum walk over each graph being compared. In particular, we adopt the closed form solution of the density matrix introduced in [27, 28] to reduce the computational complexity and to avoid the cumbersome task of simulating the quantum walk evolution explicitly. Next, we compare the mixed states represented by the density matrices using the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence. With the quantum states for a pair of graphs described by their density matrices to hand, the quantum graph kernel between the pair of graphs is defined using the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence between the graph density matrices. We evaluate the performance of our kernel on several standard graph datasets from both bioinformatics and computer vision. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quantum graph kernel.},

  abstract = {Lattice gauge theories, which originated from particle physics in the context of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), provide an important intellectual stimulus to further develop quantum information technologies. While one long-term goal is the reliable quantum simulation of currently intractable aspects of QCD itself, lattice gauge theories also play an important role in condensed matter physics and in quantum information science. In this way, lattice gauge theories provide both motivation and a framework for interdisciplinary research towards the development of special purpose digital and analog quantum simulators, and ultimately of scalable universal quantum computers. In this manuscript, recent results and new tools from a quantum science approach to study lattice gauge theories are reviewed. Two new complementary approaches are discussed: first, tensor network methods are presented - a classical simulation approach - applied to the study of lattice gauge theories together with some results on Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Then, recent proposals for the implementation of lattice gauge theory quantum simulators in different quantum hardware are reported, e.g., trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting circuits. Finally, the first proof-of-principle trapped ions experimental quantum simulations of the Schwinger model are reviewed.},

These algorithms treat the cost function as a Hamiltonian on spin degrees of freedom and simulate the relaxation of the system to a low energy configuration using local update rules on the spins. Whereas the emphasis in [1] was on theoretical worst-case analysis, we here investigate performance in practice through benchmarking experiments on instances of the MAXCUT problem.Through heuristic arguments we propose formulas for choosing the hyperparameters of the algorithm which are found to be in good agreement with the optimal choices determined from experiment. We observe that the local tensor method is closely related to gradient descent on a relaxation of maxcut to continuous variables, but consistently outperforms gradient descent in all instances tested. We find time to solution achieved by the local tensor method is highly uncorrelated with that achieved by a widely used commercial optimization package; on some MAXCUT instances the local tensor method beats the commercial solver in time to solution by up to two orders of magnitude and vice-versa. Finally, we argue that the local tensor method closely follows discretized, imaginary-time dynamics of the system under the problem Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {Physically motivated classical heuristic optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA) treat the objective function as an energy landscape, and allow walkers to escape local minima. It has been argued that quantum properties such as tunneling may give quantum algorithms advantage in finding ground states of vast, rugged cost landscapes. Indeed, the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QAO) and the recent Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) have shown promising results on various problem instances that are considered classically hard. Here, building on previous observations from [1, 2], we argue that the type of control strategy used by the optimization algorithm may be crucial to its success. Along with SA, QAO, and QAOA, we define a new, bang-bang version of simulated annealing, BBSA, and study the performance of these algorithms on two well-studied problem instances from the literature. Both classically and quantumly, the successful control strategy is found to be bangbang, exponentially outperforming the quasistatic analogues on the same instances. Lastly, we construct O(1)-depth QAOA protocols for a class of symmetric cost functions, and provide an accompanying physical picture.},

We also give asymptotically tight characterizations of T for all symmetric f in the exact, zero-error, and bounded-error settings. Finally, we give new precise bounds for AND, OR, and PARITY.

In this work, we prove that hypergraph symmetries in the adjacency matrix model allow at most a polynomial separation between randomized and quantum query complexities. We also show that, remarkably, permutation groups constructed out of these symmetries are essentially the only permutation groups that prevent super-polynomial quantum speedups. We prove this by fully characterizing the primitive permutation groups that allow super-polynomial quantum speedups. In contrast, in the adjacency list model for bounded-degree graphs (where graph symmetry is manifested differently), we exhibit a property testing problem that shows an exponential quantum speedup.

This enables quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories where the magnetic fourbody interactions arising in two and more spatial dimensions are obtained without the use of perturbation theory, thus resulting in stronger interactions compared with analogue approaches. The simulation scheme is applicable to lattice gauge theories with either compact or finite gauge groups. The required bounds on the digitization errors in lattice gauge theories, due to the sequential nature of the stroboscopic time evolution, are provided. Furthermore, an implementation of a lattice gauge theory with a non-abelian gauge group, the dihedral group D3, is proposed employing the aforementioned simulation scheme using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},

Following Shor's result that factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of \$\textbackslash NP\$ can be efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1 the class \$\textbackslash NP\$ cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine (QTM) in time \$o(2\^\{n/2\})\$. We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1 the class \$\textbackslash NP \textbackslash cap \textbackslash coNP\$ cannot be solved on a QTM in time \$o(2\^\{n/3\})\$. The former bound is tight since recent work of Grover [in \{\textbackslash it Proc.\textbackslash{} \$28\$th Annual ACM Symposium Theory Comput.\}, 1996] shows how to accept the class \$\textbackslash NP\$ relative to any oracle on a quantum computer in time \$O(2\^\{n/2\})\$.},

Our first result is the existence of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutsch's model of a quantum Turing machine (QTM) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97--117]. This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction for classical Turing machines (TMs); in fact, even simple primitives such as looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation of polynomially bounded dimension.We also consider the precision to which the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified. We prove that \$O(\textbackslash log T)\$ bits of precision suffice to support a T step computation. This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. We give the first formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity theoretic) formulation of the Church--Turing thesis. We show the existence of a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class \$\textbackslash BPP\$. The class \$\textbackslash BQP\$ of languages that are efficiently decidable (with small error-probability) on a quantum Turing machine satisfies \$\textbackslash BPP \textbackslash subseteq \textbackslash BQP \textbackslash subseteq \textbackslash Ptime\^\{\textbackslash SP\}\$. Therefore, there is no possibility of giving a mathematical proof that quantum Turing machines are more powerful than classical probabilistic Turing machines (in the unrelativized setting) unless there is a major breakthrough in complexity theory.}

Unlike previous approaches based on product formulas, the query complexity is independent of the number of qubits acted on, and for time-varying Hamiltonians, the gate complexity is logarithmic in the norm of the derivative of the Hamiltonian. Our algorithm is based on a significantly improved simulation of the continuous- and fractional-query models using discrete quantum queries, showing that the former models are not much more powerful than the discrete model even for very small error. We also simplify the analysis of this conversion, avoiding the need for a complex fault correction procedure. Our simplification relies on a new form of "oblivious amplitude amplification" that can be applied even though the reflection about the input state is unavailable. Finally, we prove new lower bounds showing that our algorithms are optimal as a function of the error.},

If C lies near a degeneracy of \^H, {$\gamma$}(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration {$\gamma$}(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed.

  abstract = {Efficient characterization of quantum devices is a significant challenge critical for the development of large scale quantum computers. We consider an experimentally motivated situation, in which we have a decent estimate of the Hamiltonian, and its parameters need to be characterized and fine-tuned frequently to combat drifting experimental variables. We use a machine learning technique known as meta-learning to learn a more efficient optimizer for this task. We consider training with the nearest-neighbor Ising model and study the trained model's generalizability to other Hamiltonian models and larger system sizes. We observe that the meta-optimizer outperforms other optimization methods in average loss over test samples. This advantage follows from the meta-optimizer being less likely to get stuck in local minima, which highly skews the distribution of the final loss of the other optimizers. In general, meta-learning decreases the number of calls to the experiment and reduces the needed classical computational resources.},

Similarly, in the domain of machine learning, an awareness of symmetries such as rotation or permutation invariance has driven impressive performance breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and other important applications. In this report, we argue that both the physics community and the broader machine learning community have much to understand and potentially to gain from a deeper investment in research concerning symmetry group equivariant machine learning architectures. For some applications, the introduction of symmetries into the fundamental structural design can yield models that are more economical (i.e. contain fewer, but more expressive, learned parameters), interpretable (i.e. more explainable or directly mappable to physical quantities), and/or trainable (i.e. more efficient in both data and computational requirements). We discuss various figures of merit for evaluating these models as well as some potential benefits and limitations of these methods for a variety of physics applications. Research and investment into these approaches will lay the foundation for future architectures that are potentially more robust under new computational paradigms and will provide a richer description of the physical systems to which they are applied.},

  abstract = {A computation in adiabatic quantum computing is implemented by traversing a path of nondegenerate eigenstates of a continuous family of Hamiltonians. We introduce a method that traverses a discretized form of the path: At each step we apply the instantaneous Hamiltonian for a random time. The resulting decoherence approximates a projective measurement onto the desired eigenstate, achieving a version of the quantum Zeno effect. If negative evolution times can be implemented with constant overhead, then the average absolute evolution time required by our method is O(L\^2/{$\Delta$}) for constant error probability, where L is the length of the path of eigenstates and {$\Delta$} is the minimum spectral gap of the Hamiltonian. The dependence of the cost on {$\Delta$} is optimal. Making explicit the dependence on the path length is useful for cases where L is much less than the general bound. The complexity of our method has a logarithmic improvement over previous algorithms of this type. The same cost applies to the discrete-time case, where a family of unitary operators is given and each unitary and its inverse can be used. Restriction to positive evolution times incurs an error that decreases exponentially with the cost. Applications of this method to unstructured search and quantum sampling are considered. In particular, we discuss the quantum simulated annealing algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. This algorithm provides a quadratic speed-up in the gap of the stochastic matrix over its classical counterpart implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo.}

  abstract = {Consider a path of non-degenerate eigenstates of unitary operators or Hamiltonians with minimum eigenvalue gap G. The eigenpath traversal problem is to transform one or more copies of the initial to the final eigenstate. Solutions to this problem have applications ranging from quantum physics simulation to optimization. For Hamiltonians, the conventional way of doing this is by applying the adiabatic theorem. We give ``digital'' methods for performing the transformation that require no assumption on path continuity or differentiability other than the absence of large jumps. Given sufficient information about eigenvalues and overlaps between states on the path, the transformation can be accomplished with complexity O(L/G log(L/e)), where L is the angular length of the path and e is a specified bound on the error of the output state. We show that the required information can be obtained in a first set of transformations, whose complexity per state transformed has an additional factor that depends logarithmically on a maximum angular velocity along the path. This velocity is averaged over constant angular distances and does not require continuity. Our methods have substantially better behavior than conventional adiabatic algorithms, with fewer conditions on the path. They also improve on the previously best digital methods and demonstrate that path length and the gap are the primary parameters that determine the complexity of state transformation along a path.},

Furthermore, the only simulable Hamiltonians are those which fail to generate entanglement. This shows that generic two-qubit commuting Hamiltonians can be used to perform computational tasks which are intractable for classical computers under plausible assumptions.

Susskind's conjectured resolution of the paradox was to equate the volume of the wormhole with the circuit complexity of its dual quantum state in the CFT. We study the ramifications of this conjecture from a complexity-theoretic perspective. Specifically we give evidence for the existence of computationally pseudorandom states in the CFT, and argue that wormhole volume is measureable in a non-physical but computational sense, by amalgamating the experiences of multiple observers in the wormhole. In other words the conjecture equates a quantity which is difficult to compute with one which is easy to compute. The pseudorandomness argument further implies that this is a necessary feature of any resolution of the wormhole growth paradox, not just of Susskind's Complexity=Volume conjecture. As a corollary we conclude that either the AdS/CFT dictionary map must be exponentially complex, or the quantum Extended Church-Turing thesis must be false in quantum gravity.},

A leading near-term candidate, put forth by the Google/UCSB team, is sampling from the probability distributions of randomly chosen quantum circuits, which we call Random Circuit Sampling (RCS). In this paper we study both the hardness and verification of RCS. While RCS was defined with experimental realization in mind, we show complexity theoretic evidence of hardness that is on par with the strongest theoretical proposals for supremacy. Specifically, we show that RCS satisfies an average-case hardness condition - computing output probabilities of typical quantum circuits is as hard as computing them in the worst-case, and therefore \#P-hard. Our reduction exploits the polynomial structure in the output amplitudes of random quantum circuits, enabled by the Feynman path integral. In addition, it follows from known results that RCS satisfies an anti-concentration property, making it the first supremacy proposal with both average-case hardness and anti-concentration.},

These algorithms are promising candidates for near-term quantum applications, but they often require fine tuning via the annealing schedule or variational parameters. In this work, we explore connections between these analog algorithms, as well as limits in which they become approximations of the optimal procedure.Notably, we explore how the optimal procedure approaches a smooth adiabatic procedure but with a superposed oscillatory pattern that can be explained in terms of the interactions between the ground state and first excited state that effect the coherent error cancellation of diabatic transitions. Furthermore, we provide numeric and analytic evidence that QAOA emulates this optimal procedure with the length of each QAOA layer equal to the period of the oscillatory pattern. Additionally, the ratios of the QAOA bangs are determined by the smooth, non-oscillatory part of the optimal procedure. We provide arguments for these phenomena in terms of the product formula expansion of the optimal procedure. With these arguments, we conclude that different analog algorithms can emulate the optimal protocol under different limits and approximations. Finally, we present a new algorithm for better approximating the optimal protocol using the analytic and numeric insights from the rest of the paper. In practice, numerically, we find that this algorithm outperforms standard QAOA and naive quantum annealing procedures.},

This is in contrast to previous works which have suggested that bang-bang (i.e., QAOA) protocols are ideal.

  abstract = {We present a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for solving the weak membership problem for the convex set of separable, i.e. non-entangled, bipartite density matrices. The algorithm decides whether a density matrix is separable or whether it is eps-away from the set of the separable states in time exp(O(eps\^-2 log |A| log |B|)), where |A| and |B| are the local dimensions, and the distance is measured with either the Euclidean norm, or with the so-called LOCC norm. The latter is an operationally motivated norm giving the optimal probability of distinguishing two bipartite quantum states, each shared by two parties, using any protocol formed by quantum local operations and classical communication (LOCC) between the parties. We also obtain improved algorithms for optimizing over the set of separable states and for computing the ground-state energy of mean-field Hamiltonians. The techniques we develop are also applied to quantum Merlin-Arthur games, where we show that multiple provers are not more powerful than a single prover when the verifier is restricted to LOCC protocols, or when the verification procedure is formed by a measurement of small Euclidean norm. This answers a question posed by Aaronson et al (Theory of Computing 5, 1, 2009) and provides two new characterizations of the complexity class QMA, a quantum analog of NP. Our algorithm uses semidefinite programming to search for a symmetric extension, as first proposed by Doherty, Parrilo and Spedialieri (Phys. Rev. A, 69, 022308, 2004). The bound on the runtime follows from an improved de Finetti-type bound quantifying the monogamy of quantum entanglement, proved in (arXiv:1010.1750). This result, in turn, follows from a new lower bound on the quantum conditional mutual information and the entanglement measure squashed entanglement.},

  abstract = {Quantum algorithms hold the promise of solving certain computational problems dramatically faster than their classical counterparts. The latest generation of quantum processors with \textasciitilde 50 qubits are expected to be at the brink of outperforming classical computers. However, due to the lack of fault tolerance, the qubits can be operated for only a few time steps, making the quantum circuits shallow in depth. Variational quantum algorithms are leading candidates in the effort to find shallow-depth quantum algorithms that outperform classical computers. Here we consider the task of computing the mean values of multi-qubit observables, which is a cornerstone of variational quantum algorithms for optimization, machine learning and the simulation of quantum many-body systems. We develop sub-exponential time classical algorithms for solving the quantum mean value problem for general classes of quantum observables and constant-depth quantum circuits. In the special case of geometrically local two-dimensional quantum circuits, the runtime of our algorithm scales linearly with the number of qubits. Our results demonstrate that appropriate choices of circuit parameters such as geometric locality and depth are essential to obtain quantum speed-ups based on variational quantum algorithms.},

  abstract = {The partition function and free energy of a quantum many-body system determine its physical properties in thermal equilibrium. Here we study the computational complexity of approximating these quantities for \$n\$-qubit local Hamiltonians. First, we report a classical algorithm with \$\textbackslash mathrm\{poly\}(n)\$ runtime which approximates the free energy of a given \$2\$-local Hamiltonian provided that it satisfies a certain denseness condition. Our algorithm combines the variational characterization of the free energy and convex relaxation methods. It contributes to a body of work on efficient approximation algorithms for dense instances of optimization problems which are hard in the general case, and can be viewed as simultaneously extending existing algorithms for (a) the ground energy of dense \$2\$-local Hamiltonians, and (b) the free energy of dense classical Ising models. Secondly, we establish polynomial-time equivalence between the problem of approximating the free energy of local Hamiltonians and three other natural quantum approximate counting problems, including the problem of approximating the number of witness states accepted by a QMA verifier. These results suggest that simulation of quantum many-body systems in thermal equilibrium may precisely capture the complexity of a broad family of computational problems that has yet to be defined or characterized in terms of known complexity classes. Finally, we summarize state-of-the-art classical and quantum algorithms for approximating the free energy and show how to improve their runtime and memory footprint.},

An equivalent characterization of stoquastic Hamiltonians is that they have an entry-wise non-negative Gibbs density matrix for any temperature. We prove that LH-MIN for stoquastic Hamiltonians belongs to the complexity class AM -- a probabilistic version of NP with two rounds of communication between the prover and the verifier. We also show that 2-local stoquastic LH-MIN is hard for the class MA. With the additional promise of having a polynomial spectral gap, we show that stoquastic LH-MIN belongs to the class POSTBPP=BPPpath -- a generalization of BPP in which a post-selective readout is allowed.

One conjecture relates to the hardness of estimating the complex-temperature partition function for random instances of the Ising model; the other concerns approximating the number of zeroes of random low-degree polynomials. We observe that both conjectures can be shown to be valid in the setting of worst-case complexity.

A number of models of quantum computation exist, including the now well-studied quantum circuit model. Although these models have been shown to be formally equivalent, their underlying elementary concepts and the requirements for their practical realization can differ significantly. The new paradigm of measurement-based quantum computation, where the processing of quantum information takes place by rounds of simple measurements on qubits prepared in a highly entangled state, is particularly exciting in this regard. In this article we discuss a number of recent developments in measurement-based quantum computation in both fundamental and practical issues, in particular regarding the power of quantum computation, the protection against noise (fault tolerance) and steps toward experimental realization.

Our QMA proof system is sound against arbitrary quantum provers, but only requires an honest prover to perform polynomial-time quantum computations, provided that it holds a quantum witness for a given instance of the QMA problem under consideration. The proof system relies on a new variant of the QMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem in which the local terms are described by Clifford operations and standard basis measurements.

The latter are based on Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory and multi-scale analysis via inductive limits of C\r{}-algebras which are applicable in arbitrary dimensions. The major step, restricted to one spatial dimension, is the explicitly construction of the spatially-localized von Neumann algebras of time-zero fields in the time gauge in representations associated with scaling limits of Gibbs states of the KogutSusskind Hamiltonian. We relate our work to existing results about YM1`1 and its counterpart in Euclidean quantum field theory (YM2). In particular, we show that the operator-algebraic approach offers a unifying perspective on results about YM1`1 obtained by Dimock as well as Driver and Hall, especially regarding the existence of dynamics. Although our constructions work for non-abelian gauge theory, we obtain the most explicit results in the abelian case by applying the results of our recent companion article. In view of the latter, we also discuss relations with the construction of unitary representations of Thompson's groups by Jones. To understand the scaling limits arising from our construction, we explain our findings via a rigorous adaptation of the Wilson-Kadanoff renormalization group, which connects our construction with the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). Finally, we discuss potential generalizations and extensions to higher dimensions (d ` 1 \v{e} 3).},

  abstract = {Quantum information processing is the emerging field that defines and realizes computing devices that make use of quantum mechanical principles, like the superposition principle, entanglement, and interference. In this review we study the information counterpart of computing. The abstract form of the distributed computing setting is called communication complexity. It studies the amount of information, in terms of bits or in our case qubits, that two spatially separated computing devices need to exchange in order to perform some computational task. Surprisingly, quantum mechanics can be used to obtain dramatic advantages for such tasks. We review the area of quantum communication complexity, and show how it connects the foundational physics questions regarding non-locality with those of communication complexity studied in theoretical computer science. The first examples exhibiting the advantage of the use of qubits in distributed information-processing tasks were based on non-locality tests. However, by now the field has produced strong and interesting quantum protocols and algorithms of its own that demonstrate that entanglement, although it cannot be used to replace communication, can be used to reduce the communication exponentially. In turn, these new advances yield a new outlook on the foundations of physics, and could even yield new proposals for experiments that test the foundations of physics.},

In this paper we show that fingerprints consisting of quantum information can be made exponentially smaller than the original strings without any correlations or entanglement between the parties: we give a scheme where the quantum fingerprints are exponentially shorter than the original strings and we give a test that distinguishes any two unknown quantum fingerprints with high probability. Our scheme implies an exponential quantum/classical gap for the equality problem in the simultaneous message passing model of communication complexity. We optimize several aspects of our scheme.},

We examine three models, the U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) lattice gauge theories which are transcribed into a spin Hamiltonian up to a cutoff in the Hilbert space of the gauge fields on the lattice. The number of qubits required for storing a particular state is found to have a linear dependence with the total number of lattice sites. The number of qubit operations required for performing the time evolution corresponding to the Hamiltonian is found to be between a linear to quadratic function of the number of lattice sites, depending on the arrangement of qubits in the quantum computer. We remark that our results may also be easily generalized to higher SU(N) gauge theories.},

In our scheme, the well-trained agent can find the subtle evolution path where most algorithmic errors cancel out, enhancing the fidelity significantly. We verified the method's validity with the transverse-field Ising model and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. Numerical calculations and experiments on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer illustrate the efficacy. The philosophy of our method, eliminating errors with errors, sheds light on error reduction on near-term quantum devices.},

  abstract = {Quantum interference phenomena are widely viewed as posing a challenge to the classical worldview. Feynman even went so far as to proclaim that they are the only mystery and the basic peculiarity of quantum mechanics. Many have also argued that such phenomena force us to accept a number of radical interpretational conclusions, including: that a photon is neither a particle nor a wave but rather a schizophrenic sort of entity that toggles between the two possibilities, that reality is observer-dependent, and that systems either do not have properties prior to measurements or else have properties that are subject to nonlocal or backwards-in-time causal influences. In this work, we show that such conclusions are not, in fact, forced on us by the phenomena. We do so by describing an alternative to quantum theory, a statistical theory of a classical discrete field (the `toy field theory') that reproduces the relevant phenomenology of quantum interference while rejecting these radical interpretational claims. It also reproduces a number of related interference experiments that are thought to support these interpretational claims, such as the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester, Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment, and the quantum eraser experiment. The systems in the toy field theory are field modes, each of which possesses, at all times, both a particle-like property (a discrete occupation number) and a wave-like property (a discrete phase). Although these two properties are jointly possessed, the theory stipulates that they cannot be jointly known. The phenomenology that is generally cited in favour of nonlocal or backwards-in-time causal influences ends up being explained in terms of inferences about distant or past systems, and all that is observer-dependent is the observer's knowledge of reality, not reality itself.},

  abstract = {Quantum walk models have been used as an algorithmic tool for quantum computation and to describe various physical processes. This paper revisits the relationship between relativistic quantum mechanics and the quantum walks. We show the similarities of the mathematical structure of the decoupled and coupled form of the discrete-time quantum walk to that of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, respectively. In the latter case, the coin emerges as an analog of the spinor degree of freedom. Discrete-time quantum walk as a coupled form of the continuous-time quantum walk is also shown by transforming the decoupled form of the discrete-time quantum walk to the Schrodinger form. By showing the coin to be a means to make the walk reversible, and that the Dirac-like structure is a consequence of the coin use, our work suggests that the relativistic causal structure is a consequence of conservation of information. However, decoherence (modelled by projective measurements on position space) generates entropy that increases with time, making the walk irreversible and thereby producing an arrow of time. Lieb-Robinson bound is used to highlight the causal structure of the quantum walk to put in perspective the relativistic structure of quantum walk, maximum speed of the walk propagation and the earlier findings related to the finite spread of the walk probability distribution. We also present a two-dimensional quantum walk model on a two state system to which the study can be extended.},

  abstract = {The celebrated Cheeger's Inequality establishes a bound on the edge expansion of a graph via its spectrum. This inequality is central to a rich spectral theory of graphs, based on studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs. It has remained open to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be used to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph. In this paper we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator generalizing the Laplacian matrix of graphs. In particular, the operator is induced by a diffusion process on the hypergraph, such that within each hyperedge, measure flows from vertices having maximum weighted measure to those having minimum. Since the operator is non-linear, we have to exploit other properties of the diffusion process to recover a spectral property concerning the "second eigenvalue" of the resulting Laplacian. Moreover, we show that higher order spectral properties cannot hold in general using the current framework. We consider a stochastic diffusion process, in which each vertex also experiences Brownian noise from outside the system. We show a relationship between the second eigenvalue and the convergence behavior of the process. We show that various hypergraph parameters like multi-way expansion and diameter can be bounded using this operator's spectral properties. Since higher order spectral properties do not hold for the Laplacian operator, we instead use the concept of procedural minimizers to consider higher order Cheeger-like inequalities. For any positive integer \$k\$, we give a polynomial time algorithm to compute an \$O(\textbackslash log r)\$-approximation to the \$k\$-th procedural minimizer, where \$r\$ is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge. We show that this approximation factor is optimal under the SSE hypothesis for constant values of \$k\$.},

  abstract = {The support vector machine (SVM) is a popular machine learning classification method which produces a nonlinear decision boundary in a feature space by constructing linear boundaries in a transformed Hilbert space. It is well known that these algorithms when executed on a classical computer do not scale well with the size of the feature space both in terms of data points and dimensionality. One of the most significant limitations of classical algorithms using non-linear kernels is that the kernel function has to be evaluated for all pairs of input feature vectors which themselves may be of substantially high dimension. This can lead to computationally excessive times during training and during the prediction process for a new data point. Here, we propose using both canonical and generalized coherent states to rapidly calculate specific nonlinear kernel functions. The key link will be the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) property for SVMs that naturally arise from canonical and generalized coherent states. Specifically, we discuss the fast evaluation of radial kernels through a positive operator valued measure (POVM) on a quantum optical system based on canonical coherent states. A similar procedure may also lead to fast calculations of kernels not usually used in classical algorithms such as those arising from generalized coherent states.},

  abstract = {Estimating the difference between quantum data is crucial in quantum computing. However, as typical characterizations of quantum data similarity, the trace distance and quantum fidelity are believed to be exponentially-hard to evaluate in general. In this work, we introduce hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for these two distance measures on near-term quantum devices where no assumption of input state is required. First, we introduce the Variational Trace Distance Estimation (VTDE) algorithm. We in particular provide the technique to extract the desired spectrum information of any Hermitian matrix by local measurement. A novel variational algorithm for trace distance estimation is then derived from this technique, with the assistance of a single ancillary qubit. Notably, VTDE could avoid the barren plateau issue with logarithmic depth circuits due to a local cost function. Second, we introduce the Variational Fidelity Estimation (VFE) algorithm. We combine Uhlmann's theorem and the freedom in purification to translate the estimation task into an optimization problem over a unitary on an ancillary system with fixed purified inputs. We then provide a purification subroutine to complete the translation. Both algorithms are verified by numerical simulations and experimental implementations, exhibiting high accuracy for randomly generated mixed states.},

Our approach is based on an analysis of the local error structure of product formulas, as introduced by Descombes and Thalhammer and significantly simplified here. We prove error bounds for canonical product formulas, which include well-known constructions such as the Lie-Trotter-Suzuki formulas. We also develop a local error representation for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation, and we discuss generalizations to periodic boundary conditions, constant-range interactions, and higher dimensions.

  abstract = {Quantum mechanical computers can solve certain problems asymptotically faster than any classical computing device. Several fast quantum algorithms are known, but the nature of quantum speedup is not well understood, and inventing new quantum algorithms seems to be difficult. In this thesis, we explore two approaches to designing quantum algorithms based on continuous-time Hamiltonian dynamics. In quantum computation by adiabatic evolution, the computer is prepared in the known ground state of a simple Hamiltonian, which is slowly modified so that its ground state encodes the solution to a problem. We argue that this approach should be inherently robust against low-temperature thermal noise and certain control errors, and we support this claim using simulations. We then show that any adiabatic algorithm can be implemented in a different way, using only a sequence of measurements of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate how this approach can achieve quadratic speedup for the unstructured search problem. We also demonstrate two examples of quantum speedup by quantum walk, a quantum mechanical analog of random walk. First, we consider the problem of searching a region of space for a marked item. Whereas a classical algorithm for this problem requires time proportional to the number of items regardless of the geometry, we show that a simple quantum walk algorithm can find the marked item quadratically faster for a lattice of dimension greater than four, and almost quadratically faster for a four-dimensional lattice. We also show that by endowing the walk with spin degrees of freedom, the critical dimension can be lowered to two. Second, we construct an oracular problem that a quantum walk can solve exponentially faster than any classical algorithm.},

  abstract = {We present a review of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model of compressible quantum many-body systems without quasiparticle excitations, and its connections to various theoretical studies of non-Fermi liquids in condensed matter physics. The review is placed in the context of numerous experimental observations on correlated electron materials. Strong correlations in metals are often associated with their proximity to a Mott transition to an insulator created by the local Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. We explore the phase diagrams of a number of models of such local electronic correlation, employing a dynamical mean field theory in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. Numerical analyses and analytical solutions, using renormalization group methods and expansions in large spin degeneracy, lead to critical regions which display SYK physics. The models studied include the single-band Hubbard model, the \$t\$-\$J\$ model and the two-band Kondo-Heisenberg model in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. We also examine non-Fermi liquids obtained by considering each SYK model with random four-fermion interactions to be a multi-orbital atom, with the SYK-atoms arranged in an infinite lattice. We connect to theories of sharp Fermi surfaces without any low-energy quasiparticles in the absence of spatial disorder, obtained by coupling a Fermi liquid to a gapless boson; a systematic large \$N\$ theory of such a critical Fermi surface, with SYK characteristics, is obtained by averaging over an ensemble of theories with random boson-fermion couplings. Finally, we present an overview of the links between the SYK model and quantum gravity and end with an outlook on open questions.},

Interesting algorithms have been discovered in this model, such as an algorithm for evaluating nand trees more efficiently than any classical algorithm. Subsequent work has shown that there also exists an efficient algorithm for nand trees in the discrete query model; however, there is no efficient conversion known for continuous-time query algorithms for arbitrary problems. We show that any quantum algorithm in the continuous-time query model whose total query time is T can be simulated by a quantum algorithm in the discrete query model that makes O[T log(T) / log(log(T))] queries. This is the first upper bound that is independent of the driving operations (i.e., it holds even if the norm of the driving Hamiltonian is very large). A corollary is that any lower bound of T queries for a problem in the discrete-time query model immediately carries over to a lower bound of \textbackslash Omega[T log(log(T))/log (T)] in the continuous-time query model.},

If the Lindbladian consists of \$\textbackslash mathrm\{poly\}(n)\$ operators that can each be expressed as a linear combination of \$\textbackslash mathrm\{poly\}(n)\$ tensor products of Pauli operators then the gate cost of our algorithm is \$O(t\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{polylog\}(t/\textbackslash epsilon)\textbackslash mathrm\{poly\}(n))\$. We also obtain similar bounds for the cases where the Lindbladian consists of local operators, and where the Lindbladian consists of sparse operators. This is remarkable in light of evidence that we provide indicating that the above efficiency is impossible to attain by first expressing Lindblad evolution as Schr\textbackslash "\{o\}dinger evolution on a larger system and tracing out the ancillary system: the cost of such a \textbackslash textit\{reduction\} incurs an efficiency overhead of \$O(t\^2/\textbackslash epsilon)\$ even before the Hamiltonian evolution simulation begins.

We show that the only constraint on the existence of threshold schemes comes from the quantum "no-cloning theorem", which requires that n {$<$} 2k, and, in all such cases, we give an efficient construction of a ((k,n)) threshold scheme. We also explore similarities and differences between quantum secret sharing schemes and quantum error-correcting codes. One remarkable difference is that, while most existing quantum codes encode pure states as pure states, quantum secret sharing schemes must use mixed states in some cases. For example, if k {$<$}= n {$<$} 2k-1 then any ((k,n)) threshold scheme must distribute information that is globally in a mixed state.},

Equivariant networks have shown excellent performance and data efficiency on vision and medical imaging problems that exhibit symmetries. Here we show how this principle can be extended beyond global symmetries to local gauge transformations. This enables the development of a very general class of convolutional neural networks on manifolds that depend only on the intrinsic geometry, and which includes many popular methods from equivariant and geometric deep learning. We implement gauge equivariant CNNs for signals defined on the surface of the icosahedron, which provides a reasonable approximation of the sphere. By choosing to work with this very regular manifold, we are able to implement the gauge equivariant convolution using a single conv2d call, making it a highly scalable and practical alternative to Spherical CNNs. Using this method, we demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods on the task of segmenting omnidirectional images and global climate patterns.},

The QCNN architecture combines the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz and quantum error correction. We explicitly illustrate its potential with two examples. First, QCNN is used to accurately recognize quantum states associated with 1D symmetry-protected topological phases. We numerically demonstrate that a QCNN trained on a small set of exactly solvable points can reproduce the phase diagram over the entire parameter regime and also provide an exact, analytical QCNN solution. As a second application, we utilize QCNNs to devise a quantum error correction scheme optimized for a given error model. We provide a generic framework to simultaneously optimize both encoding and decoding procedures and find that the resultant scheme significantly outperforms known quantum codes of comparable complexity. Finally, potential experimental realization and generalizations of QCNNs are discussed.},

  abstract = {Path integral quantum Monte Carlo (PIMC) is a method for estimating thermal equilibrium properties of stoquastic quantum spin systems by sampling from a classical Gibbs distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo. The PIMC method has been widely used to study the physics of materials and for simulated quantum annealing, but these successful applications are rarely accompanied by formal proofs that the Markov chains underlying PIMC rapidly converge to the desired equilibrium distribution. In this work we analyze the mixing time of PIMC for 1D stoquastic Hamiltonians, including disordered transverse Ising models (TIM) with long-range algebraically decaying interactions as well as disordered XY spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions. By bounding the convergence time to the equilibrium distribution we rigorously justify the use of PIMC to approximate partition functions and expectations of observables for these models at inverse temperatures that scale at most logarithmically with the number of qubits. The mixing time analysis is based on the canonical paths method applied to the single-site Metropolis Markov chain for the Gibbs distribution of 2D classical spin models with couplings related to the interactions in the quantum Hamiltonian. Since the system has strongly nonisotropic couplings that grow with system size, it does not fall into the known cases where 2D classical spin models are known to mix rapidly.},

We then show that certain very simple spin-lattice models are universal in this very strong sense. Examples include the Heisenberg and XY models on a 2D square lattice (with non-uniform coupling strengths). We go on to fully classify all two-qubit interactions, determining which are universal and which can only simulate more restricted classes of models.

  abstract = {Entanglement in the ground state of a many-body quantum system may arise when the local terms in the system Hamiltonian fail to commute with the interaction terms in the Hamiltonian. We quantify this phenomenon, demonstrating an analogy between ground-state entanglement and the phenomenon of frustration in spin systems. In particular, we prove that the amount of ground-state entanglement is bounded above by a measure of the extent to which interactions frustrate the local terms in the Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we show that the amount of ground-state entanglement is bounded above by a ratio between parameters characterizing the strength of interactions in the system, and the local energy scale. Finally, we prove a qualitatively similar result for other energy eigenstates of the system.},

This phenomenon is captured and quantified through uncertainty relations. Although studied since the inception of quantum theory, the problem of determining the possible expectation values of a collection of quantum measurements remains, in general, unsolved. By constructing a close connection between observables and graph theory, we derive uncertainty relations valid for any set of dichotomic observables. These relations are, in many cases, tight, and related to the size of the maximum clique of the associated graph. As applications, our results can be straightforwardly used to formulate entropic uncertainty relations, separability criteria and entanglement witnesses.},

Traditionally this has been taken to mean that a graph network must be equivariant to node permutations. Here we show that instead of equivariance, the more general concept of naturality is sufficient for a graph network to be well-defined, opening up a larger class of graph networks. We define global and local natural graph networks, the latter of which are as scalable as conventional message passing graph neural networks while being more flexible. We give one practical instantiation of a natural network on graphs which uses an equivariant message network parameterization, yielding good performance on several benchmarks.}

We consider the sampling complexity as a function of time \$t\$ due to evolution generated by spatially local quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians. We obtain an upper bound on the scaling of \$t\$ with the number of bosons \$n\$ for which approximate sampling is classically efficient. We also obtain a lower bound on the scaling of \$t\$ with \$n\$ for which any instance of the boson sampling problem reduces to this problem and hence implies that the problem is hard, assuming the conjectures of Aaronson and Arkhipov [Proc. 43rd Annu. ACM Symp. Theory Comput. STOC '11]. This establishes a dynamical phase transition in sampling complexity. Further, we show that systems in the Anderson-localized phase are always easy to sample from at arbitrarily long times. We view these results in the light of classifying phases of physical systems based on parameters in the Hamiltonian. In doing so, we combine ideas from mathematical physics and computational complexity to gain insight into the behavior of condensed matter, atomic, molecular and optical systems.},

  abstract = {The field of quantum Hamiltonian complexity lies at the intersection of quantum many-body physics and computational complexity theory, with deep implications to both fields. The main object of study is the LocalHamiltonian problem, which is concerned with estimating the ground-state energy of a local Hamiltonian and is complete for the class QMA, a quantum generalization of the class NP. A major challenge in the field is to understand the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian problem in more physically natural parameter regimes. One crucial parameter in understanding the ground space of any Hamiltonian in many-body physics is the spectral gap, which is the difference between the smallest two eigenvalues. Despite its importance in quantum many-body physics, the role played by the spectral gap in the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian is less well-understood. In this work, we make progress on this question by considering the precise regime, in which one estimates the ground-state energy to within inverse exponential precision. Computing ground-state energies precisely is a task that is important for quantum chemistry and quantum many-body physics. In the setting of inverse-exponential precision, there is a surprising result that the complexity of LocalHamiltonian is magnified from QMA to PSPACE, the class of problems solvable in polynomial space. We clarify the reason behind this boost in complexity. Specifically, we show that the full complexity of the high precision case only comes about when the spectral gap is exponentially small. As a consequence of the proof techniques developed to show our results, we uncover important implications for the representability and circuit complexity of ground states of local Hamiltonians, the theory of uniqueness of quantum witnesses, and techniques for the amplification of quantum witnesses in the presence of postselection.},

  abstract = {The new quantum mechanics, when applied to the problem of the structure of the atom with point-charge electrons, does not give results in agreement with experiment. The discrepancies consist of ``duplexity '' phenomena, the observed number of stationary states for an electron in an atom being twice the number given by the theory. To meet the difficulty, Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck have introduced the idea of an electron with a spin angular momentum of half a quantum and a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton. This model for the electron has been fitted into the new mechanics by Pauli,* and Darwin,\textdagger{} working with an equivalent theory, has shown that it gives results in agreement with experiment for hydrogen-like spectra to the first order of accuracy. The question remains as to why Nature should have chosen this particular model for the electron instead of being satisfied with the point-charge. One would like to find some incompleteness in the previous methods of applying quantum mechanics to the point-charge electron such that, when removed, the whole of the duplexity phenomena follow without arbitrary assumptions. In the present paper it is shown that this is the case, the incompleteness of the previous theories lying in their disagreement with relativity, or, alternatetively, with the general transformation theory of quantum mechanics. It appears that the simplest Hamiltonian for a point-charge electron satisfying the requirements of both relativity and the general transformation theory leads to an explanation of all duplexity phenomena without further assumption. All the same there is a great deal of truth in the spinning electron model, at least as a first approximation. The most important failure of the model seems to be that the magnitude of the resultant orbital angular momentum of an electron moving in an orbit in a central field of force is not a constant, as the model leads one to expect.}

  abstract = {We introduce a new family of separability criteria that are based on the existence of extensions of a bipartite quantum state \$\textbackslash rho\$ to a larger number of parties satisfying certain symmetry properties. It can be easily shown that all separable states have the required extensions, so the non-existence of such an extension for a particular state implies that the state is entangled. One of the main advantages of this approach is that searching for the extension can be cast as a convex optimization problem known as a semidefinite program (SDP). Whenever an extension does not exist, the dual optimization constructs an explicit entanglement witness for the particular state. These separability tests can be ordered in a hierarchical structure whose first step corresponds to the well-known Positive Partial Transpose (Peres-Horodecki) criterion, and each test in the hierarchy is at least as powerful as the preceding one. This hierarchy is complete, in the sense that any entangled state is guaranteed to fail a test at some finite point in the hierarchy, thus showing it is entangled. The entanglement witnesses corresponding to each step of the hierarchy have well-defined and very interesting algebraic properties that in turn allow for a characterization of the interior of the set of positive maps. Coupled with some recent results on the computational complexity of the separability problem, which has been shown to be NP-hard, this hierarchy of tests gives a complete and also computationally and theoretically appealing characterization of mixed bipartite entangled states.},

This paper investigates many of the basic geometric objects associated to this space, including the Levi-Civita connection, the geodesic equation, the curvature, and the Jacobi equation. We show that the optimal Hamiltonian evolution for synthesis of a desired unitary necessarily obeys a simple universal geodesic equation. As a consequence, once the initial value of the Hamiltonian is set, subsequent changes to the Hamiltonian are completely determined by the geodesic equation. We develop many analytic solutions to the geodesic equation, and a set of invariants that completely determine the geodesics. We investigate the problem of finding minimal geodesics through a desired unitary, U, and develop a procedure which allows us to deform the (known) geodesics of a simple and well understood metric to the geodesics of the metric of interest in quantum computation. This deformation procedure is illustrated using some three-qubit numerical examples. We study the computational complexity of evaluating distances on Riemmanian manifolds, and show that no efficient classical algorithm for this problem exists, subject to the assumption that good pseudorandom generators exist. Finally, we develop a canonical extension procedure for unitary operations which allows ancilla qubits to be incorporated into the geometric approach to quantum computing.},

The scheme involves laser manipulation of atomic ensembles, beam splitters, and single-photon detectors with moderate efficiencies, and therefore well fits the status of the current experimental technology.

As an application of Griffiths' second inequality forD=2, an interesting relation between the ``parallel'' and ``transverse'' two-point correlations is obtained.},

Many fundamental results follow strictly from modular invariance, giving rise to the numerical modular bootstrap program. Here we report a way to assign to a particular family of quantum error correcting codes a family of "code CFTs" CFTs", which forms a subset of the space of Narain CFTs. This correspondence reduces modular invariance of the 2d CFT partition function to a few simple algebraic relations obeyed by a multivariate polynomial characterizing the corresponding code. Using this relation we construct many explicit examples of physically distinct isospectral theories, as well as many examples of nonholomorphic functions, which satisfy all basic properties of the 2d CFT partition function, yet are not associated with any known CFT.},

  abstract = {Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: The entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such "area laws" for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium we review the current status of area laws in these fields. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation, and disordered systems, non-equilibrium situations, classical correlation concepts, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. A significant proportion of the article is devoted to the quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. We discuss matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogues, and states from entanglement renormalization and conclude by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations.},

  abstract = {We introduce a quantum neural network, QNN, that can represent labeled data, classical or quantum, and be trained by supervised learning. The quantum circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent unitary transformations which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classification a single Pauli operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the quantum neural network's predictor of the binary label of the input state. First we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made from two qubit unitaries that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean function of n bits. For certain label functions the circuit is exponentially long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted by supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data consisting of downsampled images of handwritten digits each of which has been labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show through classical simulation that parameters can be found that allow the QNN to learn to correctly distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum superpositions of computational basis states corresponding to different label values. Here we show through simulation that learning is possible. We consider using our QNN to learn the label of a general quantum state. By example we show that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical simulation of small quantum systems. The QNN proposed here was designed with near-term quantum processors in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this QNN on a near term gate model quantum computer where its power can be explored beyond what can be explored with simulation.},

The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

We prove that if the classical strategy succeeds in reaching level n in time polynomial in n, then so does the quantum algorithm.

  abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is designed to run on a gate model quantum computer and has shallow depth. It takes as input a combinatorial optimization problem and outputs a string that satisfies a high fraction of the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied. For certain problems the lowest depth version of the QAOA has provable performance guarantees although there exist classical algorithms that have better guarantees. Here we argue that beyond its possible computational value the QAOA can exhibit a form of ``Quantum Supremacy'' in that, based on reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions, the output distribution of even the lowest depth version cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical device. We contrast this with the case of sampling from the output of a quantum computer running the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QADI) with the restriction that the Hamiltonian that governs the evolution is gapped and stoquastic. Here we show that there is an oracle that would allow sampling from the QADI but even with this oracle, if one could efficiently classically sample from the output of the QAOA, the Polynomial Hierarchy would collapse. This suggests that the QAOA is an excellent candidate to run on near term quantum computers not only because it may be of use for optimization but also because of its potential as a route to establishing Quantum Supremacy.},

  abstract = {A line of work initiated by Terhal and DiVincenzo and Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd, shows that quantum computers can efficiently sample from probability distributions that cannot be exactly sampled efficiently on a classical computer, unless the PH collapses. Aaronson and Arkhipov take this further by considering a distribution that can be sampled efficiently by linear optical quantum computation, that under two feasible conjectures, cannot even be approximately sampled classically within bounded total variation distance, unless the PH collapses. In this work we use Quantum Fourier Sampling to construct a class of distributions that can be sampled by a quantum computer. We then argue that these distributions cannot be approximately sampled classically, unless the PH collapses, under variants of the Aaronson and Arkhipov conjectures. In particular, we show a general class of quantumly sampleable distributions each of which is based on an "Efficiently Specifiable" polynomial, for which a classical approximate sampler implies an average-case approximation. This class of polynomials contains the Permanent but also includes, for example, the Hamiltonian Cycle polynomial, and many other familiar \#P-hard polynomials. Although our construction, unlike that proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov, likely requires a universal quantum computer, we are able to use this additional power to weaken the conjectures needed to prove approximate sampling hardness results.},

  abstract = {Bell non-locality represents the ultimate consequence of quantum entanglement, fundamentally undermining the classical tenet that spatially-separated degrees of freedom possess objective attributes independently of the act of their measurement. Despite its importance, probing Bell non-locality in many-body systems is considered to be a formidable challenge, with a computational cost scaling exponentially with system size. Here we propose and validate an efficient variational scheme, based on the solution of inverse classical Ising problems, which in polynomial time can probe whether an arbitrary set of quantum data is compatible with a local theory; and, if not, it delivers a many-body Bell inequality violated by the quantum data. We use our approach to unveil new many-body Bell inequalities, violated by suitable measurements on paradigmatic quantum states (the low-energy states of Heisenberg antiferromagnets), paving the way to systematic Bell tests in the many-body realm.},

An important open question is what characterizes the representational power of deep and shallow neural networks, which is of fundamental interest due to popularity of the deep learning methods. Here, we give a rigorous proof that a deep neural network can efficiently represent most physical states, including those generated by any polynomial size quantum circuits or ground states of many body Hamiltonians with polynomial-size gaps, while a shallow network through a restricted Boltzmann machine cannot efficiently represent those states unless the polynomial hierarchy in computational complexity theory collapses.},

  abstract = {Constraint satisfaction problems are a central pillar of modern computational complexity theory. This survey provides an introduction to the rapidly growing field of Quantum Hamiltonian Complexity, which includes the study of quantum constraint satisfaction problems. Over the past decade and a half, this field has witnessed fundamental breakthroughs, ranging from the establishment of a "Quantum Cook-Levin Theorem" to deep insights into the structure of 1D low-temperature quantum systems via so-called area laws. Our aim here is to provide a computer science-oriented introduction to the subject in order to help bridge the language barrier between computer scientists and physicists in the field. As such, we include the following in this survey: (1) The motivations and history of the field, (2) a glossary of condensed matter physics terms explained in computer-science friendly language, (3) overviews of central ideas from condensed matter physics, such as indistinguishable particles, mean field theory, tensor networks, and area laws, and (4) brief expositions of selected computer science-based results in the area. For example, as part of the latter, we provide a novel information theoretic presentation of Bravyi's polynomial time algorithm for Quantum 2-SAT.},

Without much argument it can be said that, of all the known data-structures, graphs are naturally suitable to model such information. But to learn to use graph data structure is a tedious job as most operations on graphs are computationally expensive, so exploring fast machine learning techniques for graph data has been an active area of research and a family of algorithms called kernel based approaches has been famous among researchers of the machine learning domain. With the help of support vector machines, kernel based methods work very well for learning with Gaussian processes. In this survey we will explore various kernels that operate on graph representations. Starting from the basics of kernel based learning we will travel through the history of graph kernels from its first appearance to discussion of current state of the art techniques in practice.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing is powerful because unitary operators describing the time-evolution of a quantum system have exponential size in terms of the number of qubits present in the system. We develop a new "Singular value transformation" algorithm capable of harnessing this exponential advantage, that can apply polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary, generalizing the optimal Hamiltonian simulation results of Low and Chuang. The proposed quantum circuits have a very simple structure, often give rise to optimal algorithms and have appealing constant factors, while usually only use a constant number of ancilla qubits. We show that singular value transformation leads to novel algorithms. We give an efficient solution to a certain "non-commutative" measurement problem and propose a new method for singular value estimation. We also show how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum. Finally, as a quantum machine learning application we show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. "Singular value transformation" is conceptually simple and efficient, and leads to a unified framework of quantum algorithms incorporating a variety of quantum speed-ups. We illustrate this by showing how it generalizes a number of prominent quantum algorithms, including: optimal Hamiltonian simulation, implementing the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse with exponential precision, fixed-point amplitude amplification, robust oblivious amplitude amplification, fast QMA amplification, fast quantum OR lemma, certain quantum walk results and several quantum machine learning algorithms. In order to exploit the strengths of the presented method it is useful to know its limitations too, therefore we also prove a lower bound on the efficiency of singular value transformation, which often gives optimal bounds.},

It can be shown quantum kernels exist that, subject to computational hardness assumptions, can not be computed classically. It is an important challenge to find quantum kernels that provide an advantage in the classification of real world data. Here we introduce a class of quantum kernels that are related to covariant quantum measurements and can be used for data that has a group structure. The kernel is defined in terms of a single fiducial state that can be optimized by using a technique called kernel alignment. Quantum kernel alignment optimizes the kernel family to minimize the upper bound on the generalisation error for a given data set. We apply this general method to a specific learning problem we refer to as labeling cosets with error and implement the learning algorithm on \$27\$ qubits of a superconducting processor.},

Gong               et al.               used an 8-by-8 two-dimensional (2D) superconducting qubit square lattice containing 62 functional qubits to show how multiple (two) walkers traverse a 2D qubit array, interfering as they go.

In our work, we have designed and fabricated an 8-by-8 two-dimensional square superconducting qubit array composed of 62 functional qubits. We used this device to demonstrate high-fidelity single- and two-particle quantum walks. Furthermore, with the high programmability of the quantum processor, we implemented a Mach-Zehnder interferometer where the quantum walker coherently traverses in two paths before interfering and exiting. By tuning the disorders on the evolution paths, we observed interference fringes with single and double walkers. Our work is a milestone in the field, bringing future larger-scale quantum applications closer to realization for noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors.},

In general this bound cannot be improved. Here we study the scaling of the correlation length as a function of the spectral gap in frustration-free local Hamiltonians, and we prove a tight bound \$\textbackslash xi=O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\textbackslash epsilon)\$ in this setting. This highlights a fundamental difference between frustration-free and frustrated systems near criticality. The result is obtained using an improved version of the combinatorial proof of correlation decay due to Aharonov, Arad, Vazirani, and Landau.},

A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations.

  abstract = {The next few years will be exciting as prototype universal quantum processors emerge, enabling implementation of a wider variety of algorithms. Of particular interest are quantum heuristics, which require experimentation on quantum hardware for their evaluation, and which have the potential to significantly expand the breadth of quantum computing applications. A leading candidate is Farhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates between applying a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating operator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact optimization, and sampling problems. Here, we introduce the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide brief descriptions of mappings for diverse problems.},

Implementing the unitary exactly requires a circuit of some minimal number of gates - the unitary's exact circuit complexity. We prove that this complexity grows linearly with the number of random gates, with unit probability, until saturating after exponentially many random gates. Our proof is surprisingly short, given the established difficulty of lower-bounding the exact circuit complexity.

It will turn out that this number of photons is proportional to NN for a traveling salesman problem with N cities and that for large numbers of cities the method in practice therefore is limited by the signal\textendash to\textendash noise ratio. The proposed method is meant purely as a gedankenexperiment.},

  abstract = {Given a class of \$q\$-local Hamiltonians, is it possible to find a simple variational state whose energy is a finite fraction of the ground state energy in the thermodynamic limit? Whereas product states often provide an affirmative answer in the case of bosonic (or qubit) models, we show that Gaussian states fail dramatically in the fermionic case, like for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. This prompts us to propose a new class of wavefunctions for SYK models inspired by the variational coupled cluster algorithm. We introduce a static ("0+0D") large-\$N\$ field theory to study the energy, two-point correlators, and entanglement properties of these states. Most importantly, we demonstrate a finite disorder-averaged approximation ratio of \$r \textbackslash approx 0.62\$ between the variational and ground state energy of SYK for \$q=4\$. Moreover, the variational states provide an exact description of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a related two-flavor SYK model.},

The physical motivation for the result is that such spin systems typically either have long-range order, in which case there are gapless modes, or have only short-range correlations, in which case there are topological excitations. The result uses a set of loop operators, analogous to those used in gauge theories, defined in terms of the spin operators of the theory. We also obtain various cluster bounds on expectation values for gapped systems. These bounds are used, under the assumption of a gap, to rule out the first case of long-range order, after which we show the existence of a topological excitation. Compared to the ground state, the topologically excited state has, up to a small error, the same expectation values for all operators acting within any local region, but it has a different momentum.},

We ask: if the spectral gap is only inverse polynomially small, will equilibration methods based on slowly changing the Hamiltonian parameters in the QMC simulation succeed in a polynomial time? We show that this is not true, by constructing counter-examples. In some examples, the space of configurations where the wavefunction has non-negligible amplitude has a nontrivial fundamental group, causing the space of trajectories in imaginary time to break into disconnected components with only negligible probability outside these components. For the simplest example we give with an abelian fundamental group, QMC does not equilibrate but still solves the optimization problem. More severe effects leading to failure to solve the optimization can occur when the fundamental group is a free group on two generators. Other examples where QMC fails have a trivial fundamental group, but still use ideas from topology relating group presentations to simplicial complexes. We define gadgets to realize these Hamiltonians as the effective low-energy dynamics of a transverse field Ising model. We present some analytic results on equilibration times which may be of some independent interest in the theory of equilibration of Markov chains. Conversely, we show that a small spectral gap implies slow equilibration at low temperature for some initial conditions and for a natural choice of local QMC updates.},

Being a quantum mechanical problem, in many cases we do not know an efficient classical witness to the optimum, or even to an approximation of the optimum. One prominent exception is when the optimum is described by a so-called "Gaussian state", also called a free fermion state. In this work we are interested in the complexity of this optimization problem when no good Gaussian state exists. Our primary testbed is the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model of random degree-\$q\$ polynomials, a model of great current interest in condensed matter physics and string theory, and one which has remarkable properties from a computational complexity standpoint. Among other results, we give an efficient classical certification algorithm for upper-bounding the largest eigenvalue in the \$q=4\$ SYK model, and an efficient quantum certification algorithm for lower-bounding this largest eigenvalue; both algorithms achieve constant-factor approximations with high probability.},

We prove that, if two observables anticommute with each other at large distance, then the nonvanishing spectral gap implies exponential decay of the corresponding correlation. When two observables commute with each other at large distance, the connected correlation function decays exponentially under the gap assumption. If the observables behave as a vector under the U(1) rotation of a global symmetry of the system, we use previous results on the large distance decay of the correlation function to show the stronger statement that the correlation function itself, rather than just the connected correlation function, decays exponentially under the gap assumption on a lattice with a certain self-similarity in (fractal) dimensions D{$<$}2. In particular, if the system is translationally invariant in one of the spatial directions, then this self-similarity condition is automatically satisfied.

  abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies each with the potential for altering how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional SVMs. In the second, a quantum kernel estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine learning.},

Motivated by experiments on programmable quantum annealing devices we revisit the question of when quantum speedup may be expected for Ising spin glass problems. We find that even though a better scaling compared to simulated classical annealing can be achieved for QMC simulations, this advantage is due to time discretization and measurements which are not possible on a physical quantum annealing device. QMC simulations in the physically relevant continuous time limit, on the other hand, do not show superiority. Our results imply that care has to be taken when using QMC simulations to assess quantum speedup potential and are consistent with recent arguments that no quantum speedup should be expected for two-dimensional spin glass problems.},

These include aspects of non-locality, bi-partite and multi-partite entanglement and its classification in terms of the Schmidt measure, the distillability properties of mixed entangled states close to a pure graph state, as well as the robustness of their entanglement under decoherence.

Several examples and classes of graphs will be discussed, where these bounds coincide.

In this paper we consider the general question of how to construct deep architectures with small learning complexity on general non-Euclidean domains, which are typically unknown and need to be estimated from the data.

  abstract = {Quantum entanglement, after playing a significant role in the development of the foundations of quantum mechanics, has been recently rediscovered as a new physical resource with potential commercial applications such as, for example, quantum cryptography, better frequency standards or quantum-enhanced positioning and clock synchronization. On the mathematical side the studies of entanglement have revealed very interesting connections with the theory of positive maps. The capacity to generate entangled states is one of the basic requirements for building quantum computers. Hence, efficient experimental methods for detection, verification and estimation of quantum entanglement are of great practical importance. Here, we propose an experimentally viable, \textbackslash emph\{direct\} detection of quantum entanglement which is efficient and does not require any \textbackslash emph\{a priori\} knowledge about the quantum state. In a particular case of two entangled qubits it provides an estimation of the amount of entanglement. We view this method as a new form of quantum computation, namely, as a decision problem with quantum data structure.},

But the essence of quantum formalism - entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen and Schr\textbackslash "odinger - waited over 70 years to enter to laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, is a potential for many quantum processes, including ``canonical'' ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation and dense coding. However, it appeared that this new resource is very complex and difficult to detect. Being usually fragile to environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation and quantifying. In particular, the authors discuss various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, quantum cryptography and point out some interrelations. They also discuss a basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within distant labs paradigm and stress some peculiarities such as irreversibility of entanglement manipulations including its extremal form - bound entanglement phenomenon. A basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.},

It gives optimal lower bounds for many problems, has application to classical complexity in formula size lower bounds, and is versatile with equivalent formulations in terms of weight schemes, eigenvalues, and Kolmogorov complexity. All these formulations rely on the principle that if an algorithm successfully computes a function then, in particular, it is able to distinguish between inputs which map to different values. We present a stronger version of the adversary method which goes beyond this principle to make explicit use of the stronger condition that the algorithm actually computes the function. This new method, which we call ADV+-, has all the advantages of the old: it is a lower bound on bounded-error quantum query complexity, its square is a lower bound on formula size, and it behaves well with respect to function composition. Moreover ADV+- is always at least as large as the adversary method ADV, and we show an example of a monotone function for which ADV+-(f)=Omega(ADV(f)\^1.098). We also give examples showing that ADV+- does not face limitations of ADV like the certificate complexity barrier and the property testing barrier.},

In particular, for estimating any \$L\$ low-weight Pauli observables, a deterministic measurement on only of order \$\textbackslash log(L)\$ copies of a quantum state suffices. In some cases, for example when some of the Pauli observables have a high weight, the derandomized procedure is substantially better than the randomized one.

Our figure of merit is the number of runs of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{E\}\$ required to achieve a desired prediction performance. We consider classical ML models that perform a measurement and record the classical outcome after each run of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{E\}\$, and quantum ML models that can access \$\textbackslash mathcal\{E\}\$ coherently to acquire quantum data; the classical or quantum data is then used to predict outcomes of future experiments.

In contrast, for achieving accurate prediction on all inputs, we prove that exponential quantum advantage is possible. For example, to predict expectations of all Pauli observables in an \$n\$-qubit system \$\textbackslash rho\$, classical ML models require \$2\^\{\textbackslash Omega(n)\}\$ copies of \$\textbackslash rho\$, but we present a quantum ML model using only \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(n)\$ copies.

However, machine learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. In this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime. For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits.},

This paper gives the first systematic and comprehensive treatment of this (bipartite) quantum separability problem, focusing on its deterministic (as opposed to randomized) computational complexity. First, I review the one-sided tests for separability, paying particular attention to the semidefinite programming methods. Then, I discuss various ways of formulating the quantum separability problem, from exact to approximate formulations, the latter of which are the paper's main focus. I then give a thorough treatment of the problem's relationship with the complexity classes NP, NP-complete, and co-NP. I also discuss extensions of Gurvits' NP-hardness result to strong NP-hardness of certain related problems. A major open question is whether the NP-contained formulation (QSEP) of the quantum separability problem is Karp-NP-complete; QSEP may be the first natural example of a problem that is Turing-NP-complete but not Karp-NP-complete. Finally, I survey all the proposed (deterministic) algorithms for the quantum separability problem, including the bounded search for symmetric extensions (via semidefinite programming), based on the recent quantum de Finetti theorem; and the entanglement-witness search (via interior-point algorithms and global optimization). These two algorithms have the lowest complexity, with the latter being the best under advice of asymptotically optimal point-coverings of the sphere.},

  abstract = {At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit (16; 4; 7; 13; 6), thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function f\texttheta{} (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.r.t. a new kernel: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We prove the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK when the data is supported on the sphere and the non-linearity is non-polynomial.},

(arXiv:1411.4028), namely, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), we present a circuit-based quantum algorithm to search for a needle in a haystack, obtaining the same quadratic speedup achieved by Grover's original algorithm. In our algorithm, the problem Hamiltonian (oracle) and a transverse field are applied alternately to the system in a periodic manner. We introduce a technique, based on spin-coherent states, to analyze the composite unitary in a single period. This composite unitary drives a closed transition between two states that have high degrees of overlap with the initial state and the target state, respectively. The transition rate in our algorithm is of order {$\Theta$}(1/{$\surd$}N), and the overlaps are of order {$\Theta$}(1), yielding a nearly optimal query complexity of T{$\simeq\surd$}N({$\pi$}/2{$\surd$}2). Our algorithm is a QAOA circuit that demonstrates a quantum advantage with a large number of iterations that is not derived from Trotterization of an adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO) algorithm. It also suggests that the analysis required to understand QAOA circuits involves a very different process from estimating the energy gap of a Hamiltonian in AQO.},

Here we study a closely related quantum field-theoretical problem: estimating the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude, in the presence of spacetime-dependent classical sources, for a massive scalar field theory in (1+1) dimensions. We show that this problem is BQP-hard; in other words, its solution enables one to solve any problem that is solvable in polynomial time by a quantum computer. Hence, the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude cannot be accurately estimated by any efficient classical algorithm, even if the field theory is very weakly coupled, unless BQP=BPP. Furthermore, the corresponding decision problem can be solved by a quantum computer in a time scaling polynomially with the number of bits needed to specify the classical source fields, and this problem is therefore BQP-complete. Our construction can be regarded as an idealized architecture for a universal quantum computer in a laboratory system described by massive phi\^4 theory coupled to classical spacetime-dependent sources.},

Whereas topological quantum computation requires anyons, permutational quantum computation can be performed with ordinary spin-1/2 particles, using a variant of the spin-network scheme of Marzuoli and Rasetti. We do not know whether permutational computation is universal. It may represent a new complexity class within BQP. Nevertheless, permutational quantum computers can in polynomial time approximate matrix elements of certain irreducible representations of the symmetric group and simulate certain processes in the Ponzano-Regge spin foam model of quantum gravity. No polynomial time classical algorithms for these problems are known.},

In this thesis, I first present necessary background material for a general physics audience and discuss existing models of quantum computation. Then, I present three results relating to various models of quantum computation: a scheme for improving the intrinsic fault tolerance of adiabatic quantum computers using quantum error detecting codes, a proof that a certain problem of estimating Jones polynomials is complete for the one clean qubit complexity class, and a generalization of perturbative gadgets which allows k-body interactions to be directly simulated using 2-body interactions.

Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics.

  abstract = {We discuss the experimental engineering of model systems for the description of QED in one spatial dimension via a mixture of bosonic \$\^\{23\}\$Na and fermionic \$\^6\$Li atoms. The local gauge symmetry is realized in an optical superlattice, using heteronuclear boson-fermion spin-changing interactions which preserve the total spin in every local collision. We consider a large number of bosons residing in the coherent state of a Bose-Einstein condensate on each link between the fermion lattice sites, such that the behavior of lattice QED in the continuum limit can be recovered. The discussion about the range of possible experimental parameters builds, in particular, upon experiences with related setups of fermions interacting with coherent samples of bosonic atoms. We determine the atomic system's parameters required for the description of fundamental QED processes, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking. This is achieved by benchmark calculations of the atomic system and of QED itself using functional integral techniques. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of one-dimensional QED may be realized with ultracold atoms using state-of-the-art experimental resources. The experimental setup proposed may provide a unique access to longstanding open questions for which classical computational methods are no longer applicable.},

  abstract = {"Cryptography is ubiquitous and plays a key role in ensuring data secrecy and integrity as well as in securing computer systems more broadly. Introduction to Modern Cryptography provides a rigorous yet accessible treatment of this fascinating subject. The authors introduce the core principles of modern cryptography, with an emphasis on formal definitions, clear assumptions, and rigorous proofs of security. The book begins by focusing on private-key cryptography, including an extensive treatment of private-key encryption, message authentication codes, and hash functions. The authors also present design principles for widely used stream ciphers and block ciphers including RC4, DES, and AES, plus provide provable constructions of stream ciphers and block ciphers from lower-level primitives. The second half of the book covers public-key cryptography, beginning with a self-contained introduction to the number theory needed to understand the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and El Gamal cryptosystems (and others), followed by a thorough treatment of several standardized public-key encryption and digital signature schemes. Integrating a more practical perspective without sacrificing rigor, this widely anticipated Second Edition offers improved treatment of:Stream ciphers and block ciphers, including modes of operation and design principlesAuthenticated encryption and secure communication sessionsHash functions, including hash-function applications and design principles Attacks on poorly implemented cryptography, including attacks on chained-CBC encryption, padding-oracle attacks, and timing attacksThe random-oracle model and its application to several standardized, widely used public-key encryption and signature schemesElliptic-curve cryptography and associated standards such as DSA/ECDSA and DHIES/ECIESContaining updated exercises and worked examples, Introduction to Modern Cryptography, Second Edition can serve as a textbook for undergraduate- or graduate-level courses in cryptography, a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners, or a general introduction suitable for self-study.

It is similar in spirit to MAX- k -SAT, which is NP-complete for k {$\geq$} 2. It was known that the problem is QMA-complete for any k {$\geq$} 3. On the other hand 1-Local Hamiltonian is in P, and hence not believed to be QMA-complete. The complexity of the 2-Local Hamiltonian problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and show that it is QMA-complete. We provide two independent proofs; our first proof uses a powerful technique for analyzing the sum of two Hamiltonians; this technique is based on perturbation theory and we believe that it might prove useful elsewhere. The second proof uses elementary linear algebra only. Using our techniques we also show that adiabatic computation with two-local interactions on qubits is equivalent to standard quantum computation.},

One of the greatest challenges now is to implement the basic quantum-computational elements in a physical system and to demonstrate that they can be reliably and scalably controlled. One of the earliest proposals for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two optical modes containing one photon. The proposal is appealing because of the ease with which photon interference can be observed. Until now, it suffered from the requirement for non-linear couplings between optical modes containing few photons. Here we show that efficient quantum computation is possible using only beam splitters, phase shifters, single photon sources and photo-detectors. Our methods exploit feedback from photo-detectors and are robust against errors from photon loss and detector inefficiency. The basic elements are accessible to experimental investigation with current technology.},

  abstract = {Quantum Error Correction will be necessary for preserving coherent states against noise and other unwanted interactions in quantum computation and communication. We develop a general theory of quantum error correction based on encoding states into larger Hilbert spaces subject to known interactions. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the perfect recovery of an encoded state after its degradation by an interaction. The conditions depend only on the behavior of the logical states. We use them to give a recovery operator independent definition of error-correcting codes. We relate this definition to four others: The existence of a left inverse of the interaction, an explicit representation of the error syndrome using tensor products, perfect recovery of the completely entangled state, and an information theoretic identity. Two notions of fidelity and error for imperfect recovery are introduced, one for pure and the other for entangled states. The latter is more appropriate when using codes in a quantum memory or in applications of quantum teleportation to communication. We show that the error for entangled states is bounded linearly by the error for pure states. A formal definition of independent interactions for qubits is given. This leads to lower bounds on the number of qubits required to correct e errors and a formal proof that the classical bounds on the probability of error of e-error-correcting codes applies to e-errorcorrecting quantum codes, provided that the interaction is dominated by an identity component.},

In contrast, whether MPS and more general tensor networks can accurately reproduce correlations in critical quantum systems, respectively quantum field theories, has not been established rigorously. Ample evidence exists: entropic considerations provide restrictions on the form of suitable Ansatz states, and numerical studies show that certain tensor networks can indeed approximate the associated correlation functions. Here we provide a complete positive answer to this question in the case of MPS and \$2D\$ conformal field theory: we give quantitative estimates for the approximation error when approximating correlation functions by MPS.

  abstract = {The search for topologically non-trivial states of matter has become an important goal for condensed matter physics. Recently, a new class of topological insulators has been proposed. These topological insulators have an insulating gap in the bulk, but have topologically protected edge states due to the time reversal symmetry. In two dimensions the helical edge states give rise to the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, in the absence of any external magnetic field. Here we review a recent theory which predicts that the QSH state can be realized in HgTe/CdTe semiconductor quantum wells. By varying the thickness of the quantum well, the band structure changes from a normal to an "inverted" type at a critical thickness \$d\_c\$. We present an analytical solution of the helical edge states and explicitly demonstrate their topological stability. We also review the recent experimental observation of the QSH state in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We review both the fabrication of the sample and the experimental setup. For thin quantum wells with well width \$d\_\{QW\}{$<$} 6.3\$ nm, the insulating regime shows the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (\$d\_\{QW\}{$>$} 6.3\$ nm), the nominally insulating regime shows a plateau of residual conductance close to \$2e\^2/h\$. The residual conductance is independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance is destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, \$d\_c= 6.3\$ nm, is also independently determined from the occurrence of a magnetic field induced insulator to metal transition.},

  abstract = {By the Gottesman-Knill Theorem, the outcome probabilities of Clifford circuits can be computed efficiently. We present an alternative proof of this result for quopit Clifford circuits (i.e., Clifford circuits on collections of p-level systems, where p is an odd prime) using Feynman's sum-over-paths technique, which allows the amplitudes of arbitrary quantum circuits to be expressed in terms of a weighted sum over computational paths. For a general quantum circuit, the sum over paths contains an exponential number of terms, and no efficient classical algorithm is known that can compute the sum. For quopit Clifford circuits, however, we show that the sum over paths takes a special form: it can be expressed as a product of Weil sums with quadratic polynomials, which can be computed efficiently. This provides a method for computing the outcome probabilities and amplitudes of such circuits efficiently, and is an application of the circuit-polynomial correspondence which relates quantum circuits to low-degree polynomials.},

  abstract = {Most existing neural networks for learning graphs address permutation invariance by conceiving of the network as a message passing scheme, where each node sums the feature vectors coming from its neighbors. We argue that this imposes a limitation on their representation power, and instead propose a new general architecture for representing objects consisting of a hierarchy of parts, which we call Covariant Compositional Networks (CCNs). Here, covariance means that the activation of each neuron must transform in a specific way under permutations, similarly to steerability in CNNs. We achieve covariance by making each activation transform according to a tensor representation of the permutation group, and derive the corresponding tensor aggregation rules that each neuron must implement. Experiments show that CCNs can outperform competing methods on standard graph learning benchmarks.},

There have been many recent attempts to generalize this framework to other domains, including graphs and data lying on manifolds. In this paper we give a rigorous, theoretical treatment of convolution and equivariance in neural networks with respect to not just translations, but the action of any compact group. Our main result is to prove that (given some natural constraints) convolutional structure is not just a sufficient, but also a necessary condition for equivariance to the action of a compact group. Our exposition makes use of concepts from representation theory and noncommutative harmonic analysis and derives new generalized convolution formulae.},

  abstract = {Graph kernels have become an established and widely-used technique for solving classification tasks on graphs. This survey gives a comprehensive overview of techniques for kernel-based graph classification developed in the past 15 years. We describe and categorize graph kernels based on properties inherent to their design, such as the nature of their extracted graph features, their method of computation and their applicability to problems in practice. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we study the classification accuracy of a large suite of graph kernels on established benchmarks as well as new datasets. We compare the performance of popular kernels with several baseline methods and study the effect of applying a Gaussian RBF kernel to the metric induced by a graph kernel. In doing so, we find that simple baselines become competitive after this transformation on some datasets. Moreover, we study the extent to which existing graph kernels agree in their predictions (and prediction errors) and obtain a data-driven categorization of kernels as result. Finally, based on our experimental results, we derive a practitioner's guide to kernel-based graph classification.},

In particular, we explore the effect of representing the gauge degrees of freedom with finite-dimensional systems and show that the results converge rapidly; thus even with small dimensions it is possible to obtain a reasonable accuracy. We also discuss the time scales required for the adiabatic preparation of the interacting vacuum state and observe that for a suitable ramping of the interaction the required time is almost insensitive to the system size and the dimension of the physical systems. Finally, we address the possible presence of noninvariant terms in the Hamiltonian that is realized in the experiment and show that for low levels of noise it is still possible to achieve a good precision for some ground-state observables, even if the gauge symmetry is not exact in the implemented model.},

The first part of the book is devoted to the simple two-party model introduced by Yao in 1979, which is still the most widely studied model. The second part treats newer models developed to deal with more complicated communication processes. Finally, applications of these models, including computer networks, VLSI circuits, and data structures, are treated in the third part of the book.

In spite of its wide use, this heuristic method is known to fail in certain cases and no certifiably correct implementation is known, leaving researchers faced with an ever-growing toolbox of heuristics, none of which is guaranteed to succeed. Here we develop a polynomial time algorithm that provably finds the ground state of any 1D quantum system described by a gapped local Hamiltonian with constant ground-state energy. The algorithm is based on a framework that combines recently discovered structural features of gapped 1D systems with an efficient construction of a class of operators called approximate ground-state projections (AGSPs). The combination of these tools yields a method that is guaranteed to succeed in all 1D gapped systems. An AGSP-centric approach may help guide the search for algorithms for more general quantum systems, including for the central challenge of 2D systems, where even heuristic methods have had more limited success.},

  abstract = {State conversion generalizes query complexity to the problem of converting between two input-dependent quantum states by making queries to the input. We characterize the complexity of this problem by introducing a natural information-theoretic norm that extends the Schur product operator norm. The complexity of converting between two systems of states is given by the distance between them, as measured by this norm. In the special case of function evaluation, the norm is closely related to the general adversary bound, a semi-definite program that lower-bounds the number of input queries needed by a quantum algorithm to evaluate a function. We thus obtain that the general adversary bound characterizes the quantum query complexity of any function whatsoever. This generalizes and simplifies the proof of the same result in the case of boolean input and output. Also in the case of function evaluation, we show that our norm satisfies a remarkable composition property, implying that the quantum query complexity of the composition of two functions is at most the product of the query complexities of the functions, up to a constant. Finally, our result implies that discrete and continuous-time query models are equivalent in the bounded-error setting, even for the general state-conversion problem.},

  abstract = {Two genuinely quantum mechanical models for an antiferromagnetic linear chain with nearest neighbor interactions are constructed and solved exactly, in the sense that the ground state, all the elementary excitations and the free energy are found. A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous correlation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter {$\lambda$} which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 12 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.},

In this work, Grover's quantum search problem is mapped to a time-optimal control problem. Resorting to Pontryagin's Minimum Principle we find that the time-optimal solution has the bang-singular-bang structure. This structure can be derived naturally, without integrating the differential equations, using the geometric control technique where Hamiltonians in the Schr\textbackslash "odinger's equation are represented as vector fields. In view of optimal control, Grover's algorithm uses the bang-bang protocol to approximate the optimal protocol with a minimized number of bang-to-bang switchings to reduce the query complexity. Our work provides a concrete example how Pontryagin's Minimum Principle is connected to quantum computation, and offers insight into how a quantum algorithm can be designed.},

  abstract = {Preparing the ground state of a given Hamiltonian and estimating its ground energy are important but computationally hard tasks. However, given some additional information, these problems can be solved efficiently on a quantum computer. We assume that an initial state with non-trivial overlap with the ground state can be efficiently prepared, and the spectral gap between the ground energy and the first excited energy is bounded from below. With these assumptions we design an algorithm that prepares the ground state when an upper bound of the ground energy is known, whose runtime has a logarithmic dependence on the inverse error. When such an upper bound is not known, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to estimate the ground energy, where the dependence of the number of queries to the initial state on the desired precision is exponentially improved compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithm proposed in [Ge et al. 2019]. These two algorithms can then be combined to prepare a ground state without knowing an upper bound of the ground energy. We also prove that our algorithms reach the complexity lower bounds by applying it to the unstructured search problem and the quantum approximate counting problem.},

In this paper, we address the pulse-level simulation of noisy quantum circuits with the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP). We introduce new tools in qutip-qip, QuTiP's quantum information processing package. These tools simulate quantum circuits at the pulse level, leveraging QuTiP's quantum dynamics solvers and control optimization features. We show how quantum circuits can be compiled on simulated processors, with control pulses acting on a target Hamiltonian that describes the unitary evolution of the physical qubits. Various types of noise can be introduced based on the physical model, e.g., by simulating the Lindblad density-matrix dynamics or Monte Carlo quantum trajectories. In particular, the user can define environment-induced decoherence at the processor level and include noise simulation at the level of control pulses. We illustrate how the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is compiled and executed on a superconducting-qubit-based processor, on a spin-chain-based processor and using control optimization algorithms. We also show how to easily reproduce experimental results on cross-talk noise in an ion-based processor, and how a Ramsey experiment can be modeled with Lindblad dynamics. Finally, we illustrate how to integrate these features with other software frameworks.},

Most of these learning algorithms either assume quantum access to data -- making it unclear if quantum speed-ups still exist without making these strong assumptions, or are heuristic in nature with no provable advantage over classical algorithms. In this paper, we establish a rigorous quantum speed-up for supervised classification using a general-purpose quantum learning algorithm that only requires classical access to data. Our quantum classifier is a conventional support vector machine that uses a fault-tolerant quantum computer to estimate a kernel function. Data samples are mapped to a quantum feature space and the kernel entries can be estimated as the transition amplitude of a quantum circuit. We construct a family of datasets and show that no classical learner can classify the data inverse-polynomially better than random guessing, assuming the widely-believed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Meanwhile, the quantum classifier achieves high accuracy and is robust against additive errors in the kernel entries that arise from finite sampling statistics.},

We provide a novel connection between \$\textbackslash mathsf\{StoqMA\}\$ and distribution testing via reversible circuits. First, we prove that easy-witness \$\textbackslash mathsf\{StoqMA\}\$ (viz. \$\textbackslash mathsf\{eStoqMA\}\$, a sub-class of \$\textbackslash mathsf\{StoqMA\}\$) is contained in \$\textbackslash mathsf\{MA\}\$. Easy witness is a generalization of a subset state such that the associated set's membership can be efficiently verifiable, and all non-zero coordinates are not necessarily uniform. This sub-class \$\textbackslash mathsf\{eStoqMA\}\$ contains \$\textbackslash mathsf\{StoqMA\}\$ with perfect completeness (\$\textbackslash mathsf\{StoqMA\}\_1\$), which further signifies a simplified proof for \$\textbackslash mathsf\{StoqMA\}\_1 \textbackslash subseteq \textbackslash mathsf\{MA\}\$ [BBT06, BT10]. Second, by showing distinguishing reversible circuits with ancillary random bits is \$\textbackslash mathsf\{StoqMA\}\$-complete (as a comparison, distinguishing quantum circuits is \$\textbackslash mathsf\{QMA\}\$-complete [JWB05]), we construct soundness error reduction of \$\textbackslash mathsf\{StoqMA\}\$. Additionally, we show that both variants of \$\textbackslash mathsf\{StoqMA\}\$ that without any ancillary random bit and with perfect soundness are contained in \$\textbackslash mathsf\{NP\}\$. Our results make a step towards collapsing the hierarchy \$\textbackslash mathsf\{MA\} \textbackslash subseteq \textbackslash mathsf\{StoqMA\} \textbackslash subseteq \textbackslash mathsf\{SBP\}\$ [BBT06], in which all classes are contained in \$\textbackslash mathsf\{AM\}\$ and collapse to \$\textbackslash mathsf\{NP\}\$ under derandomization assumptions.},

The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences that are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k.

Further, by training our system with measurement results that include simulated noise sources we are able to demonstrate a significantly enhanced average fidelity when compared to typical reconstruction methods. These enhancements in average fidelity are also shown to persist when we consider state reconstruction from partial tomography data where several measurements are missing. We anticipate that the present results combining the fields of machine intelligence and quantum state estimation will greatly improve and speed up tomography-based quantum experiments.},

  abstract = {There is a large body of evidence for the potential of greater computational power using information carriers that are quantum mechanical over those governed by the laws of classical mechanics. But the question of the exact nature of the power contributed by quantum mechanics remains only partially answered. Furthermore, there exists doubt over the practicality of achieving a large enough quantum computation that definitively demonstrates quantum supremacy. Recently the study of computational problems that produce samples from probability distributions has added to both our understanding of the power of quantum algorithms and lowered the requirements for demonstration of fast quantum algorithms. The proposed quantum sampling problems do not require a quantum computer capable of universal operations and also permit physically realistic errors in their operation. This is an encouraging step towards an experimental demonstration of quantum algorithmic supremacy. In this paper, we will review sampling problems and the arguments that have been used to deduce when sampling problems are hard for classical computers to simulate. Two classes of quantum sampling problems that demonstrate the supremacy of quantum algorithms are BosonSampling and IQP Sampling. We will present the details of these classes and recent experimental progress towards demonstrating quantum supremacy in BosonSampling.},

  abstract = {Adversarial machine learning is an emerging field that focuses on studying vulnerabilities of machine learning approaches in adversarial settings and developing techniques accordingly to make learning robust to adversarial manipulations. It plays a vital role in various machine learning applications and has attracted tremendous attention across different communities recently. In this paper, we explore different adversarial scenarios in the context of quantum machine learning. We find that, similar to traditional classifiers based on classical neural networks, quantum learning systems are likewise vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, independent of whether the input data is classical or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier that achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively deceived by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible perturbations to the original legitimate samples. This is explicitly demonstrated with quantum adversarial learning in different scenarios, including classifying real-life images (e.g., handwritten digit images in the dataset MNIST), learning phases of matter (such as, ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected topological phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that based on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical defense strategies can be designed to fight against a number of different attacks. Our results uncover the notable vulnerability of quantum machine learning systems to adversarial perturbations, which not only reveals a novel perspective in bridging machine learning and quantum physics in theory but also provides valuable guidance for practical applications of quantum classifiers based on both near-term and future quantum technologies.},

Despite the proposed many methods such as the positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion and the k-symmetric extendibility criterion to tackle this problem in practice, none of them enables a general, effective solution to the problem even for small dimensions. Explicitly, separable states form a high-dimensional convex set, which exhibits a vastly complicated structure. In this work, we build a new separability-entanglement classifier underpinned by machine learning techniques.

A natural question of both theoretical and experimental importance is whether universal entanglement detection is possible without full state tomography. In this work, we prove a no-go theorem that rules out this possibility for any non-adaptive schemes that employ single-copy measurements only. We also examine in detail a previously implemented experiment, which claimed to detect entanglement of two-qubit states via adaptive single-copy measurements without full state tomography. By performing the experiment and analyzing the data, we demonstrate that the information gathered is indeed sufficient to reconstruct the state. These results reveal a fundamental limit for single-copy measurements in entanglement detection, and provides a general framework to study the detection of other interesting properties of quantum states, such as the positivity of partial transpose and the \$k\$-symmetric extendibility.},

The main new idea is to apply quantum phase estimation to the quantum walk in order to implement an approximate reflection operator. This operator is then used in an amplitude amplification scheme. As a result we considerably expand the scope of the previous approaches of Ambainis (2004) and Szegedy (2004). Our algorithm combines the benefits of these approaches in terms of being able to find marked elements, incurring the smaller cost of the two, and being applicable to a larger class of Markov chains. In addition, it is conceptually simple and avoids some technical difficulties in the previous analyses of several algorithms based on quantum walk.},

A basic challenge in developing such networks is finding the maximal collection of invariant and equivariant linear layers. Although this question is answered for the first three examples (for popular transformations, at-least), a full characterization of invariant and equivariant linear layers for graphs is not known. In this paper we provide a characterization of all permutation invariant and equivariant linear layers for (hyper-)graph data, and show that their dimension, in case of edge-value graph data, is 2 and 15, respectively. More generally, for graph data defined on k-tuples of nodes, the dimension is the k-th and 2k-th Bell numbers. Orthogonal bases for the layers are computed, including generalization to multi-graph data. The constant number of basis elements and their characteristics allow successfully applying the networks to different size graphs. From the theoretical point of view, our results generalize and unify recent advancement in equivariant deep learning. In particular, we show that our model is capable of approximating any message passing neural network Applying these new linear layers in a simple deep neural network framework is shown to achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art and to have better expressivity than previous invariant and equivariant bases.},

Previous constructions for reducing error required a polynomial increase in the length of Merlin's message. Applications of this fact include a proof that logarithmic length quantum certificates yield no increase in power over BQP and a simple proof that QMA is contained in PP. Other facts that are proved include the equivalence of three (or more) message quantum Arthur-Merlin games with ordinary quantum interactive proof systems and some basic properties concerning two-message quantum Arthur-Merlin games.},

  abstract = {Gauge theories are fundamental to our understanding of interactions between the elementary constituents of matter as mediated by gauge bosons. However, computing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for classical computational methods. In the spirit of Feynman's vision of a quantum simulator, this has recently stimulated theoretical effort to devise schemes for simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the difficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws (Gauss laws) need to be implemented. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by realising 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) on a few-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time evolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare vacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous creation of electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum resources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge fields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which have a direct and efficient implementation on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger mechanism of particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production and the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time evolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle creation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents a first step towards quantum simulating high-energy theories with atomic physics experiments, the long-term vision being the extension to real-time quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.},

Subject to gap dependencies, our algorithm obtains an almost quintic speedup in the number of datapoints over rigorous state-of-the-art classical algorithms for calculating the persistent Betti numbers to constant additive error - the salient task for applications. However, this may be reduced to closer to quadratic when compared against heuristic classical methods and observed scalings. We discuss whether quantum algorithms can achieve an exponential speedup for tasks of practical interest, as claimed previously. We conclude that there is currently no evidence that this is the case.},

Conceptually, EQGCs serve as a unifying framework for quantum graph representation learning, allowing us to define several interesting subclasses which subsume existing proposals. In terms of the representation power, we prove that the studied subclasses of EQGCs are universal approximators for functions over the bounded graph domain. This theoretical perspective on quantum graph machine learning methods opens many directions for further work, and could lead to models with capabilities beyond those of classical approaches. We empirically verify the expressive power of EQGCs through a dedicated experiment on synthetic data, and additionally observe that the performance of EQGCs scales well with the depth of the model and does not suffer from barren plateu issues.},

First, we may consider quantum testers for properties of classical objects. We survey the main examples known where quantum testers can be much (sometimes exponentially) more efficient than classical testers. Second, we may consider classical testers of quantum objects. This is the situation that arises for instance when one is trying to determine if quantum states or operations do what they are supposed to do, based only on classical input-output behavior. Finally, we may also consider quantum testers for properties of quantum objects, such as states or operations. We survey known bounds on testing various natural properties, such as whether two states are equal, whether a state is separable, whether two operations commute, etc. We also highlight connections to other areas of quantum information theory and mention a number of open questions.},

We study two quantum walks on the n-dimensional hypercube, one in discrete time and one in continuous time. In both cases we show that the quantum walk mixes in (\textbackslash pi/4)n steps, faster than the O(n log n) steps required by the classical walk. In the continuous-time case, the probability distribution is \{\textbackslash em exactly\} uniform at this time. More importantly, these walks expose several subtleties in the definition of mixing time for quantum walks. Even though the continuous-time walk has an O(n) instantaneous mixing time at which it is precisely uniform, it never approaches the uniform distribution when the stopping time is chosen randomly as in [AharonovAKV2001]. Our analysis treats interference between terms of different phase more carefully than is necessary for the walk on the cycle; previous general bounds predict an exponential, rather than linear, mixing time for the hypercube.},

  abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is considered to be one of the most promising approaches towards using near-term quantum computers for practical application. In its original form, the algorithm applies two different Hamiltonians, called the mixer and the cost Hamiltonian, in alternation with the goal being to approach the ground state of the cost Hamiltonian. Recently, it has been suggested that one might use such a set-up as a parametric quantum circuit with possibly some other goal than reaching ground states. From this perspective, a recent work (Lloyd, arXiv:1812.11075) argued that for one-dimensional local cost Hamiltonians, composed of nearest neighbour ZZ terms, this set-up is quantum computationally universal and provides a universal gate set, i.e. all unitaries can be reached up to arbitrary precision. In the present paper, we complement this work by giving a complete proof and the precise conditions under which such a one-dimensional QAOA might produce a universal gate set. We further generalize this type of gate-set universality for certain cost Hamiltonians with ZZ and ZZZ terms arranged according to the adjacency structure of certain graphs and hypergraphs.},

The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

On the other hand, the minimum amount of local noise necessary to induce separability on states arising from N Bose symmetric extensions with Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) decreases at least as fast as O(1/N\^2). From these results, we derive upper bounds on the time and space complexity of the weak membership problem of separability when attacked via algorithms that search for PPT symmetric extensions. Finally, we show how to estimate the error we incur when we approximate the set of separable states by the set of (PPT) N -extendable quantum states in order to compute the maximum average fidelity in pure state estimation problems, the maximal output purity of quantum channels, and the geometric measure of entanglement.},

  abstract = {Topological quantum computation has recently emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as \{\textbackslash it Non-Abelian anyons\}, meaning that they obey \{\textbackslash it non-Abelian braiding statistics\}. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations which are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles, and then measuring the multi-quasiparticle states. The fault-tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the non-local encoding of the states of the quasiparticles, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the \textbackslash nu=5/2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices and thin film superconductors. In this review article, we describe current research in this field, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. We address both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject using the \textbackslash nu=5/2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

  abstract = {We investigate the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. This work consists of two parts. First we develop new classical simulation algorithms that are centered on sampling methods. Using these techniques we generate new classes of classically simulatable quantum circuits where standard techniques relying on the exact computation of measurement probabilities fail to provide efficient simulations. For example, we show how various concatenations of matchgate, Toffoli, Clifford, bounded-depth, Fourier transform and other circuits are classically simulatable. We also prove that sparse quantum circuits as well as circuits composed of CNOT and exp[iaX] gates can be simulated classically. In a second part, we apply our results to the simulation of quantum algorithms. It is shown that a recent quantum algorithm, concerned with the estimation of Potts model partition functions, can be simulated efficiently classically. Finally, we show that the exponential speed-ups of Simon's and Shor's algorithms crucially depend on the very last stage in these algorithms, dealing with the classical postprocessing of the measurement outcomes. Specifically, we prove that both algorithms would be classically simulatable if the function classically computed in this step had a sufficiently peaked Fourier spectrum.},

  abstract = {Inverse problems in statistical physics are motivated by the challenges of `big data' in different fields, in particular high-throughput experiments in biology. In inverse problems, the usual procedure of statistical physics needs to be reversed: Instead of calculating observables on the basis of model parameters, we seek to infer parameters of a model based on observations. In this review, we focus on the inverse Ising problem and closely related problems, namely how to infer the coupling strengths between spins given observed spin correlations, magnetisations, or other data. We review applications of the inverse Ising problem, including the reconstruction of neural connections, protein structure determination, and the inference of gene regulatory networks. For the inverse Ising problem in equilibrium, a number of controlled and uncontrolled approximate solutions have been developed in the statistical mechanics community. A particularly strong method, pseudolikelihood, stems from statistics. We also review the inverse Ising problem in the non-equilibrium case, where the model parameters must be reconstructed based on non-equilibrium statistics.},

  abstract = {What is the minimal size quantum circuit required to exactly implement a specified n-qubit unitary operation, U, without the use of ancilla qubits? We show that a lower bound on the minimal size is provided by the length of the minimal geodesic between U and the identity, I, where length is defined by a suitable Finsler metric on SU(2\^n). The geodesic curves of such a metric have the striking property that once an initial position and velocity are set, the remainder of the geodesic is completely determined by a second order differential equation known as the geodesic equation. This is in contrast with the usual case in circuit design, either classical or quantum, where being given part of an optimal circuit does not obviously assist in the design of the rest of the circuit. Geodesic analysis thus offers a potentially powerful approach to the problem of proving quantum circuit lower bounds. In this paper we construct several Finsler metrics whose minimal length geodesics provide lower bounds on quantum circuit size, and give a procedure to compute the corresponding geodesic equation. We also construct a large class of solutions to the geodesic equation, which we call Pauli geodesics, since they arise from isometries generated by the Pauli group. For any unitary U diagonal in the computational basis, we show that: (a) provided the minimal length geodesic is unique, it must be a Pauli geodesic; (b) finding the length of the minimal Pauli geodesic passing from I to U is equivalent to solving an exponential size instance of the closest vector in a lattice problem (CVP); and (c) all but a doubly exponentially small fraction of such unitaries have minimal Pauli geodesics of exponential length.},

  abstract = {Understanding the computational power of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is of both fundamental and practical importance to quantum information science. Here, we address the question of whether error-uncorrected noisy quantum computers can provide computational advantage over classical computers. Specifically, we study noisy random circuit sampling in one dimension (or 1D noisy RCS) as a simple model for exploring the effects of noise on the computational power of a noisy quantum device. In particular, we simulate the real-time dynamics of 1D noisy random quantum circuits via matrix product operators (MPOs) and characterize the computational power of the 1D noisy quantum system by using a metric we call MPO entanglement entropy. The latter metric is chosen because it determines the cost of classical MPO simulation. We numerically demonstrate that for the two-qubit gate error rates we considered, there exists a characteristic system size above which adding more qubits does not bring about an exponential growth of the cost of classical MPO simulation of 1D noisy systems. Specifically, we show that above the characteristic system size, there is an optimal circuit depth, independent of the system size, where the MPO entanglement entropy is maximized. Most importantly, the maximum achievable MPO entanglement entropy is bounded by a constant that depends only on the gate error rate, not on the system size. We also provide a heuristic analysis to get the scaling of the maximum achievable MPO entanglement entropy as a function of the gate error rate. The obtained scaling suggests that although the cost of MPO simulation does not increase exponentially in the system size above a certain characteristic system size, it does increase exponentially as the gate error rate decreases, possibly making classical simulation practically not feasible even with state-of-the-art supercomputers.},

  abstract = {Finding the ground state energy of electrons subject to an external electric field is a fundamental problem in computational chemistry. We prove that this electronic-structure problem, when restricted to a fixed single-particle basis and fixed number of electrons, is QMA-complete. Schuch and Verstraete have shown hardness for the electronic-structure problem with an additional site-specific external magnetic field, but without the restriction to a fixed basis [20]. In their reduction, a local Hamiltonian on qubits is encoded in the site-specific magnetic field. In our reduction, the local Hamiltonian is encoded in the choice of spatial orbitals used to discretize the electronic-structure Hamiltonian. As a step in their proof, Schuch and Verstraete show a reduction from the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian to the FermiHubbard Hamiltonian. We combine this reduction with the fact that the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian is QMA-hard [18] to observe that the Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian on generic graphs is QMA-hard, even when all the hopping coefficients have the same sign. We then reduce from FermiHubbard by showing that an instance of Fermi-Hubbard can be closely approximated by an instance of the Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian in a fixed basis. Finally, we show that estimating the energy of the lowest-energy Slater-determinant state (i.e., the Hartree-Fock state) is NP-complete for the ElectronicStructure Hamiltonian in a fixed basis.},

Our results are partially derived with novel perturbation gadgets that employ mediator qubits which allow us to manipulate k-local interactions. As a side result, we obtain that quantum adiabatic computation using 2-local interactions restricted to a 2-D square lattice is equivalent to the circuit model of quantum computation. Our perturbation method also shows how any stabilizer space associated with a k-local stabilizer (for constant k) can be generated as an approximate ground-space of a 2-local Hamiltonian.},

This model is exactly solvable using the Jordan-Wigner transform, and it is possible to calculate the two-site reduced density matrix for all pairs of sites. Using the two-site density matrix, the entanglement of formation between any two sites is calculated for all parameter values and temperatures. We also study the entanglement in the transverse Ising model, a special case of the XY model, which exhibits a quantum phase transition. It is found that the next-nearest neighbour entanglement (though not the nearest-neighbour entanglement) is a maximum at the critical point. Furthermore, we show that the critical point in the transverse Ising model corresponds to a transition in the behaviour of the entanglement between a single site and the remainder of the lattice.},

  abstract = {Fermionic Linear Optics (FLO) is a restricted model of quantum computation which in its original form is known to be efficiently classically simulable. We show that, when initialized with suitable input states, FLO circuits can be used to demonstrate quantum computational advantage with strong hardness guarantees. Based on this, we propose a quantum advantage scheme which is a fermionic analogue of Boson Sampling: Fermion Sampling with magic input states. We consider in parallel two classes of circuits: particle-number conserving (passive) FLO and active FLO that preserves only fermionic parity and is closely related to Matchgate circuits introduced by Valiant. Mathematically, these classes of circuits can be understood as fermionic representations of the Lie groups \$U(d)\$ and \$SO(2d)\$. This observation allows us to prove our main technical results. We first show anticoncentration for probabilities in random FLO circuits of both kind. Moreover, we prove robust average-case hardness of computation of probabilities. To achieve this, we adapt the worst-to-average-case reduction based on Cayley transform, introduced recently by Movassagh, to representations of low-dimensional Lie groups. Taken together, these findings provide hardness guarantees comparable to the paradigm of Random Circuit Sampling. Importantly, our scheme has also a potential for experimental realization. Both passive and active FLO circuits are relevant for quantum chemistry and many-body physics and have been already implemented in proof-of-principle experiments with superconducting qubit architectures. Preparation of the desired quantum input states can be obtained by a simple quantum circuit acting independently on disjoint blocks of four qubits and using 3 entangling gates per block. We also argue that due to the structured nature of FLO circuits, they can be efficiently certified.},

  abstract = {It is straightforward to give a sum-over-paths expression for the transition amplitudes of a quantum circuit as long as the gates in the circuit are balanced, where to be balanced is to have all nonzero transition amplitudes of equal magnitude. Here we consider the question of whether, for such circuits, the relative phases of different discrete-time paths through the configuration space can be defined in terms of a classical action, as they are for continuous-time paths. We show how to do so for certain kinds of quantum circuits, namely, Clifford circuits where the elementary systems are continuous-variable systems or discrete systems of odd-prime dimension. These types of circuit are distinguished by having phase-space representations that serve to define their classical counterparts. For discrete systems, the phase-space coordinates are also discrete variables. We show that for each gate in the generating set, one can associate a symplectomorphism on the phase-space and to each of these one can associate a generating function, defined on two copies of the configuration space. For discrete systems, the latter association is achieved using tools from algebraic geometry. Finally, we show that if the action functional for a discrete-time path through a sequence of gates is defined using the sum of the corresponding generating functions, then it yields the correct relative phases for the path-sum expression. These results are likely to be relevant for quantizing physical theories where time is fundamentally discrete, characterizing the classical limit of discrete-time quantum dynamics, and proving complexity results for quantum circuits.},

  abstract = {Tensor network algorithms provide a suitable route for tackling real-time dependent problems in lattice gauge theories, enabling the investigation of out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We analyze a U(1) lattice gauge theory in (1+1) dimensions in the presence of dynamical matter for different mass and electric field couplings, a theory akin to quantum-electrodynamics in one-dimension, which displays string-breaking: the confining string between charges can spontaneously break during quench experiments, giving rise to charge-anticharge pairs according to the Schwinger mechanism. We study the real-time spreading of excitations in the system by means of electric field and particle fluctuations: we determine a dynamical state diagram for string breaking and quantitatively evaluate the time-scales for mass production. We also show that the time evolution of the quantum correlations can be detected via bipartite von Neumann entropies, thus demonstrating that the Schwinger mechanism is tightly linked to entanglement spreading. To present the variety of possible applications of this simulation platform, we show how one could follow the real-time scattering processes between mesons and the creation of entanglement during scattering processes. Finally, we test the quality of quantum simulations of these dynamics, quantifying the role of possible imperfections in cold atoms, trapped ions, and superconducting circuit systems. Our results demonstrate how entanglement properties can be used to deepen our understanding of basic phenomena in the real-time dynamics of gauge theories such as string breaking and collisions.},

Digital computers may never be able to achieve accurate simulations of such phenomena in QCD and other strongly-coupled field theories; quantum computers will do so eventually, though I'm not sure when. Progress toward quantum simulation of quantum field theory will require the collaborative efforts of quantumists and field theorists, and though the physics payoff may still be far away, it's worthwhile to get started now. Today's research can hasten the arrival of a new era in which quantum simulation fuels rapid progress in fundamental physics.},

Furthermore, our circuit demands only local gates in a two dimensional circuit -- we show how to implement it in a highly parallelized way on an architecture similar to that of Google's Sycamore processor. With these features, our algorithm brings the task of multivariate trace estimation, crucial to applications in condensed matter and estimating nonlinear functions of quantum states, closer to the capabilities of near-term quantum processors. We instantiate the latter application with a theorem on estimating nonlinear functions of quantum states with ``well-behaved" polynomial approximations.},

We provide a framework that allows different simulation methods to be hybridized and thereby improve performance for interaction picture simulations over known algorithms. These approaches show asymptotic improvements over the individual methods that comprise them and further make interaction picture simulation methods practical in the near term. Physical applications of these hybridized methods yield a gate complexity scaling as \$\textbackslash log\^2 \textbackslash Lambda\$ in the electric cutoff \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ for the Schwinger Model and independent of the electron density for collective neutrino oscillations, outperforming the scaling for all current algorithms with these parameters. For the general problem of Hamiltonian simulation subject to dynamical constraints, these methods yield a query complexity independent of the penalty parameter \$\textbackslash lambda\$ used to impose an energy cost on time-evolution into an unphysical subspace.},

  abstract = {Recently, a physically realistic protocol amplifying the randomness of Santha-Vazirani sources producing cryptographically secure random bits was proposed; however for reasons of practical relevance, the crucial question remained open whether this can be accomplished under the minimal conditions necessary for the task. Namely, is it possible to achieve randomness amplification using only two no-signaling components and in a situation where the violation of a Bell inequality only guarantees that some outcomes of the device for specific inputs exhibit randomness? Here, we solve this question and present a device-independent protocol for randomness amplification of Santha-Vazirani sources using a device consisting of two non-signaling components. We show that the protocol can amplify any such source that is not fully deterministic into a fully random source while tolerating a constant noise rate and prove the composable security of the protocol against general no-signaling adversaries. Our main innovation is the proof that even the partial randomness certified by the two-party Bell test (a single input-output pair (\$\textbackslash textbf\{u\}\^*, \textbackslash textbf\{x\}\^*\$) for which the conditional probability \$P(\textbackslash textbf\{x\}\^* | \textbackslash textbf\{u\}\^*)\$ is bounded away from \$1\$ for all no-signaling strategies that optimally violate the Bell inequality) can be used for amplification. We introduce the methodology of a partial tomographic procedure on the empirical statistics obtained in the Bell test that ensures that the outputs constitute a linear min-entropy source of randomness. As a technical novelty that may be of independent interest, we prove that the Santha-Vazirani source satisfies an exponential concentration property given by a recently discovered generalized Chernoff bound.},

Our construction applies to all finite dimensions, with the most interesting case being that of qubits. For multiple qubits, we find that quantum computation by Clifford gates and Pauli measurements on magic states can be efficiently classically simulated if the quasiprobability distribution of the magic states is non-negative. This provides the so far missing qubit counterpart of the corresponding result [V. Veitch et al., New J. Phys. 14, 113011 (2012)] applying only to odd dimension. Our approach is more general than previous ones based on mixtures of stabilizer states. Namely, all mixtures of stabilizer states can be efficiently simulated, but for any number of qubits there also exist efficiently simulable states outside the stabilizer polytope. Further, our simulation method extends to negative quasiprobability distributions, where it provides amplitude estimation. The simulation cost is then proportional to a robustness measure squared. For all quantum states, this robustness is smaller than or equal to robustness of magic.},

  abstract = {Supervised machine learning is the classification of new data based on already classified training examples. In this work, we show that the support vector machine, an optimized binary classifier, can be implemented on a quantum computer, with complexity logarithmic in the size of the vectors and the number of training examples. In cases when classical sampling algorithms require polynomial time, an exponential speed-up is obtained. At the core of this quantum big data algorithm is a non-sparse matrix exponentiation technique for efficiently performing a matrix inversion of the training data inner-product (kernel) matrix.},

  abstract = {The general adversary bound is a semi-definite program (SDP) that lower-bounds the quantum query complexity of a function. We turn this lower bound into an upper bound, by giving a quantum walk algorithm based on the dual SDP that has query complexity at most the general adversary bound, up to a logarithmic factor. In more detail, the proof has two steps, each based on "span programs," a certain linear-algebraic model of computation. First, we give an SDP that outputs for any boolean function a span program computing it that has optimal "witness size." The optimal witness size is shown to coincide with the general adversary lower bound. Second, we give a quantum algorithm for evaluating span programs with only a logarithmic query overhead on the witness size. The first result is motivated by a quantum algorithm for evaluating composed span programs. The algorithm is known to be optimal for evaluating a large class of formulas. The allowed gates include all constant-size functions for which there is an optimal span program. So far, good span programs have been found in an ad hoc manner, and the SDP automates this procedure. Surprisingly, the SDP's value equals the general adversary bound. A corollary is an optimal quantum algorithm for evaluating "balanced" formulas over any finite boolean gate set. The second result extends span programs' applicability beyond the formula evaluation problem. A strong universality result for span programs follows. A good quantum query algorithm for a problem implies a good span program, and vice versa. Although nearly tight, this equivalence is nontrivial. Span programs are a promising model for developing more quantum algorithms.},

While existence proofs guarantee that a suitable witness can be constructed for every entangled state, such assurances do not apply to fidelity witnesses. Recent results have found that entangled states that cannot be detected by a fidelity witness, known as unfaithful states, are exceedingly common among bipartite states. In this paper, we show that even among two-qubit states, the simplest of all entangled states, unfaithful states can be created through a suitable application of decoherence and filtering to a Bell state. We also show that the faithfulness is not monotonic to entanglement, as measured by the concurrence. Finally, we experimentally verify our predictions using polarization-entangled photons and specifically demonstrate a situation where an unfaithful state is brought to faithfulness at the expense of further reducing the entanglement of the state.},

  abstract = {The Landau description of phase transitions relies on the identification of a local order parameter that indicates the onset of a symmetry-breaking phase. In contrast, topological phase transitions evade this paradigm and, as a result, are harder to identify. Recently, machine learning techniques have been shown to be capable of characterizing topological order in the presence of human supervision. Here, we propose an unsupervised approach based on diffusion maps that learns topological phase transitions from raw data without the need of manual feature engineering. Using bare spin configurations as input, the approach is shown to be capable of classifying samples of the two-dimensional XY model by winding number and capture the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We also demonstrate the success of the approach on the Ising gauge theory, another paradigmatic model with topological order. In addition, a connection between the output of diffusion maps and the eigenstates of a quantum-well Hamiltonian is derived. Topological classification via diffusion maps can therefore enable fully unsupervised studies of exotic phases of matter.},

We apply this time-dependent Hamiltonian approach to the Grover's problem, i. e., searching a marked item in an unstructured database. We find that, by adjusting the evolution rate of the Hamiltonian so as to keep the evolution adiabatic on each infinitesimal time interval, the total running time is of order \$\textbackslash sqrt\{N\}\$, where \$N\$ is the number of items in the database. We thus recover the advantage of Grover's standard algorithm as compared to a classical search, scaling as \$N\$. This is in contrast with the constant-rate adiabatic approach developed by Farhi et al., where the requirement of adiabaticity is expressed only globally, resulting in a time of order \$N\$.},

We illustrate our discussion with data from a randomized benchmark test on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. Comparing the performance of the device on random spin glass instances with limited precision to simulated classical and quantum annealers, we find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered, and obtain inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results for one particular benchmark do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate that quantum speedup is elusive and can depend on the question posed.},

In this paper, we propose a novel kernel on unattributed graphs where the structure is characterized through the evolution of a continuous-time quantum walk. More precisely, given a pair of graphs, we create a derived structure whose degree of symmetry is maximum when the original graphs are isomorphic. With this new graph to hand, we compute the density operators of the quantum systems representing the evolutions of two suitably defined quantum walks. Finally, we define the kernel between the two original graphs as the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence between these two density operators. The experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The adiabatic algorithm is known to return the ground state for sufficiently long preparation times which depend on the a priori unknown spectral gap. Our work relates in a twofold way. First, we propose a method to obtain information about the spectral profile of the adiabatic evolution. Second, we present the concept of a variational quantum adiabatic algorithm (VQAA) for optimized adiabatic paths. We aim at combining the strengths of the adiabatic and the variational approaches for fast and high-fidelity ground state preparation while keeping the number of measurements as low as possible. Our algorithms build upon ancilla protocols which we present that allow to directly evaluate the ground state overlap. We benchmark for a non-integrable spin-1/2 transverse and longitudinal Ising chain with \$N=53\$ sites using tensor network techniques. Using a black box, gradient-based approach, we report a reduction in the total evolution time for a given desired ground state overlap by a factor of ten, which makes our method suitable for the limited decoherence time of noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices.},

We characterize all achievable states in terms of classes of matrix product states and give a recipe for the generation on demand of any multi-qubit state. The proposed methods are suitable for any sequential generation-scheme, though we focus on streams of single photon time-bin qubits emitted by an atom coupled to an optical cavity. We show, in particular, how to generate familiar quantum information states such as W, GHZ, and cluster states, within such a framework.},

  abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a numerical algorithm for the efficient truncation of the Hilbert space of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum systems based on a rather general decimation prescription. This algorithm has achieved unprecedented precision in the description of one-dimensional quantum systems. It has therefore quickly acquired the status of method of choice for numerical studies of one-dimensional quantum systems. Its applications to the calculation of static, dynamic and thermodynamic quantities in such systems are reviewed. The potential of DMRG applications in the fields of two-dimensional quantum systems, quantum chemistry, three-dimensional small grains, nuclear physics, equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics, and time-dependent phenomena is discussed. This review also considers the theoretical foundations of the method, examining its relationship to matrix-product states and the quantum information content of the density matrices generated by DMRG.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

  abstract = {The basic idea of quantum computing is surprisingly similar to that of kernel methods in machine learning, namely to efficiently perform computations in an intractably large Hilbert space. In this paper we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms. We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyse the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. This kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we can use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space. We illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous-variable system, and visualise the working principle with \$2\$-dimensional mini-benchmark datasets.},

Our method employs a classical model for spin which is quantized by path integration. The model, the spherical top, is a natural one from a group-theoretic point of view and has been used before in a similar context. The curvature and multiple connectedness of the top coordinate space [SO(3)] provide some interesting features in the sum over paths. The Green's function which results from this procedure propagates all spins, and recovery of the usual Pauli spinors from this formalism is achieved by projection to a specific spin subspace.}

  abstract = {Entanglement witnesses are operators that are crucial for confirming the generation of specific quantum systems, such as multipartite and high-dimensional states. For this reason, many witnesses have been theoretically derived which commonly focus on establishing tight bounds and exhibit mathematical compactness as well as symmetry properties similar to that of the quantum state. However, for increasingly complex quantum systems, established witnesses have lacked experimental achievability, as it has become progressively more challenging to design the corresponding experiments. Here, we present a universal approach to derive entanglement witnesses that are capable of detecting the presence of any targeted complex pure quantum system and that can be customized towards experimental restrictions or accessible measurement settings. Using this technique, we derive experimentally optimized witnesses that are able to detect multipartite d-level cluster states, and that require only two measurement settings. We present explicit examples for customizing the witness operators given different realistic experimental restrictions, including witnesses for high-dimensional entanglement that use only two-dimensional projection measurements. Our work enables us to confirm the presence of probed quantum states using methods that are compatible with practical experimental realizations in different quantum platforms.}

In this paper, we present a quantum search algorithm based on the quantum random walk architecture that provides such a speed-up. It will be shown that this algorithm performs an oracle search on a database of \$N\$ items with \$O(\textbackslash sqrt\{N\})\$ calls to the oracle, yielding a speed-up similar to other quantum search algorithms.

  abstract = {A major open problem in communication complexity is whether or not quantum protocols can be exponentially more efficient than classical protocols on \_total\_ Boolean functions in the two-party interactive model. The answer appears to be ``No''. In 2002, Razborov proved this conjecture for so far the most general class of functions F(x, y) = f(x\_1 * y\_1, x\_2 * y\_2, ..., x\_n * y\_n), where f is a\_symmetric\_ Boolean function on n Boolean inputs, and x\_i, y\_i are the i'th bit of x and y, respectively. His elegant proof critically depends on the symmetry of f. We develop a lower-bound method that does not require symmetry and prove the conjecture for a broader class of functions. Each of those functions F(x, y) is obtained by what we call the ``block-composition'' of a ``building block'' g : \{0, 1\}\^k by \{0, 1\}\^k --{$>$} \{0, 1\}, with an f : \{0, 1\}\^n --{$>\lbrace$}0, 1\vphantom\{\}, such that F(x, y) = f(g(x\_1, y\_1), g(x\_2, y\_2), ..., g(x\_n, y\_n)), where x\_i and y\_i are the i'th k-bit block of x and y, respectively. We show that as long as g itself is ``hard'' enough, its block-composition with an\_arbitrary\_ f has polynomially related quantum and classical communication complexities. Our approach gives an alternative proof for Razborov's result (albeit with a slightly weaker parameter), and establishes new quantum lower bounds. For example, when g is the Inner Product function for k=\textbackslash Omega(\textbackslash log n), the\_deterministic\_ communication complexity of its block-composition with\_any\_ f is asymptotically at most the quantum complexity to the power of 7.},

  abstract = {A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time by at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

We present here a problem of distinguishing between two fairly natural classes of functions, which can provably be solved exponentially faster in the quantum model than in the classical probabilistic one, when the function is given as an oracle drawn equiprobably from the uniform distribution on either class. We thus offer compelling evidence that the quantum model may have significantly more complexity theoretic power than the PTM. In fact, drawing on this work, Shor has recently developed remarkable new quantum polynomial-time algorithms for the discrete logarithm and integer factoring problems.}

  abstract = {Inspired by random walk on graphs, diffusion map (DM) is a class of unsupervised machine learning that offers automatic identification of low-dimensional data structure hidden in a high-dimensional dataset. In recent years, among its many applications, DM has been successfully applied to discover relevant order parameters in many-body systems, enabling automatic classification of quantum phases of matter. However, classical DM algorithm is computationally prohibitive for a large dataset, and any reduction of the time complexity would be desirable. With a quantum computational speedup in mind, we propose a quantum algorithm for DM, termed quantum diffusion map (qDM). Our qDM takes as an input \$N\$ classical data vectors, performs an eigen-decomposition of the Markov transition matrix in time \$O(\textbackslash log\^3 N)\$, and classically constructs the diffusion map via the readout (tomography) of the eigenvectors, giving a total expected runtime proportional to \$N\^2 \textbackslash text\{polylog\}\textbackslash, N\$. Lastly, quantum subroutines in qDM for constructing a Markov transition matrix, and for analyzing its spectral properties can also be useful for other random walk-based algorithms.},

We find power-law distributions with very heavy tails, corresponding to extremely hard instances, but far broader distributions - and thus worse performance for hard instances - for simulated quantum annealing than for simulated annealing. Fast, non-adiabatic, annealing schedules can improve the performance of simulated quantum annealing for very hard instances by many orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {In recent years simulations of chemistry and condensed materials has emerged as one of the preeminent applications of quantum computing offering an exponential speedup for the solution of the electronic structure for certain strongly correlated electronic systems. To date, most treatments have ignored the question of whether relativistic effects, which are described most generally by quantum electrodynamics (QED), can also be simulated on a quantum computer in polynomial time. Here we show that effective QED, which is equivalent to QED to second order in perturbation theory, can be simulated in polynomial time under reasonable assumptions while properly treating all four components of the wavefunction of the fermionic field. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of such simulations in position and momentum basis using Trotter-Suzuki formulas. We find that the number of \$T\$-gates needed to perform such simulations on a 3D lattice of \$n\_s\$ sites scales at worst as \$O(n\_s\^3/\textbackslash epsilon)\^\{1+o(1)\}\$ in the thermodynamic limit for position basis simulations and \$O(n\_s\^\{4+2/3\}/\textbackslash epsilon)\^\{1+o(1)\}\$ in momentum basis. We also find that qubitization scales slightly better with a worst case scaling of \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}(n\_s\^\{2+2/3\}/\textbackslash epsilon)\$ for lattice eQED and complications in the prepare circuit leads to a slightly worse scaling in momentum basis of \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}(n\_s\^\{5+2/3\}/\textbackslash epsilon)\$. We further provide concrete gate counts for simulating a relativistic version of the uniform electron gas that show challenging problems can be simulated using fewer than \$10\^\{13\}\$ non-Clifford operations and also provide a detailed discussion of how to prepare MRCISD states in effective QED which provide a reasonable initial guess for the groundstate. Finally, we estimate the planewave cutoffs needed to accurately simulate heavy elements such as gold.},

  abstract = {Quantum simulations of chemistry in first quantization offer important advantages over approaches in second quantization including faster convergence to the continuum limit and the opportunity for practical simulations outside the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. However, as all prior work on quantum simulation in first quantization has been limited to asymptotic analysis, it has been impossible to compare the resources required for these approaches to those for more commonly studied algorithms in second quantization. Here, we analyze and optimize the resources required to implement two first quantized quantum algorithms for chemistry from Babbush et al that realize block encodings for the qubitization and interaction picture frameworks of Low et al. The two algorithms we study enable simulation with gate complexities \$\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash cal O\}(\textbackslash eta\^\{8/3\}N\^\{1/3\}t+\textbackslash eta\^\{4/3\}N\^\{2/3\}t)\$ and \$\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash cal O\}(\textbackslash eta\^\{8/3\} N\^\{1/3\} t)\$ where \$\textbackslash eta\$ is the number of electrons, \$N\$ is the number of plane wave basis functions, and \$t\$ is the duration of time-evolution (\$t\$ is inverse to target precision when the goal is to estimate energies). In addition to providing the first explicit circuits and constant factors for any first quantized simulation and introducing improvements which reduce circuit complexity by about a thousandfold over naive implementations for modest sized systems, we also describe new algorithms that asymptotically achieve the same scaling in a real space representation. We assess the resources required to simulate various molecules and materials and conclude that the qubitized algorithm will often be more practical than the interaction picture algorithm. We demonstrate that our qubitized algorithm often requires much less surface code spacetime volume for simulating millions of plane waves than the best second quantized algorithms require for simulating hundreds of Gaussian orbitals.},

Quantum computing provides an alternative to the perturbation paradigm, yet state-of-the-art quantum processors with tens of noisy qubits are of limited practical utility. Here, we introduce perturbative quantum simulation, which combines the complementary strengths of the two approaches, enabling the solution of large practical quantum problems using limited noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. The use of a quantum processor eliminates the need to identify a solvable unperturbed Hamiltonian, while the introduction of perturbative coupling permits the quantum processor to simulate systems larger than the available number of physical qubits. We present an explicit perturbative expansion that mimics the Dyson series expansion and involves only local unitary operations, and show its optimality over other expansions under certain conditions. We numerically benchmark the method for interacting bosons, fermions, and quantum spins in different topologies, and study different physical phenomena, such as information propagation, charge-spin separation, and magnetism, on systems of up to 48 qubits only using an 8+1 qubit quantum hardware. We demonstrate our scheme on the IBM quantum cloud, verifying its noise robustness and illustrating its potential for benchmarking large quantum processors with smaller ones.}

Grover (1996)and a number of more recent results, including the element distinctness result of Ambainis and the result of Ambainis, Kempe and Rivosh that computes properties of quantum walks on the d-dimensional torus. Among the consequences is a faster search for multiple marked items. We show that the quantum escape time, just like its classical version, depends on the spectral properties of the transition matrix with the marked rows and columns deleted.},

  abstract = {We introduce quantized bipartite walks, compute their spectra, generalize the algorithms of Grover \textbackslash cite\{g\} and Ambainis \textbackslash cite\{amb03\} and interpret them as quantum walks with memory. We compare the performance of walk based classical and quantum algorithms and show that the latter run much quicker in general. Let \$P\$ be a symmetric Markov chain with transition probabilities \$P[i,j]\$, \$(i ,j\textbackslash in [n])\$. Some elements of the state space are marked. We are promised that the set of marked elements has size either zero or at least \$\textbackslash epsilon n\$. The goal is to find out with great certainty which of the above two cases holds. Our model is a black box that can answer certain yes/no questions and can generate random elements picked from certain distributions. More specifically, by request the black box can give us a uniformly distributed random element for the cost of \$\textbackslash wp\_\{0\}\$. Also, when ``inserting'' an element \$i\$ into the black box we can obtain a random element \$j\$, where \$j\$ is distributed according to \$P[i,j]\$. The cost of the latter operation is \$\textbackslash wp\_\{1\}\$. Finally, we can use the black box to test if an element \$i\$ is marked, and this costs us \$\textbackslash wp\_\{2\}\$. If \$\textbackslash delta\$ is the eigenvalue gap of \$P\$, there is a simple classical algorithm with cost \$O(\textbackslash wp\_\{0\} + (\textbackslash wp\_\{1\}+\textbackslash wp\_\{2\})/\textbackslash delta\textbackslash epsilon)\$ that solves the above promise problem. (The algorithm is efficient if \$\textbackslash wp\_\{0\}\$ is much larger than \$\textbackslash wp\_\{1\}+\textbackslash wp\_\{2\}\$.) In contrast,we show that for the ``quantized'' version of the algorithm it costs only \$O(\textbackslash wp\_\{0\} + (\textbackslash wp\_\{1\}+\textbackslash wp\_\{2\})/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash delta\textbackslash epsilon\})\$ to solve the problem. We refer to this as the \$\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash delta\textbackslash epsilon\}\$ rule. Among the technical contributions we give a formula for the spectrum of the product of two general reflections.},

Notable progress has been made, driving the birth of a series of quantum-based algorithms that take advantage of quantum computational power. In this paper, we provide a targeted survey of the development of QC for graph-related tasks. We first elaborate the correlations between quantum mechanics and graph theory to show that quantum computers are able to generate useful solutions that can not be produced by classical systems efficiently for some problems related to graphs. For its practicability and wide-applicability, we give a brief review of typical graph learning techniques designed for various tasks. Inspired by these powerful methods, we note that advanced quantum algorithms have been proposed for characterizing the graph structures. We give a snapshot of quantum graph learning where expectations serve as a catalyst for subsequent research. We further discuss the challenges of using quantum algorithms in graph learning, and future directions towards more flexible and versatile quantum graph learning solvers.},

We give the first classical algorithm to produce a recommendation in O(poly(k) polylog(m, n)) time, which is an exponential improvement on previous algorithms that run in time linear in m and n. Our strategy is inspired by a quantum algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash: like the quantum algorithm, instead of reconstructing a user's full list of preferences, we only seek a randomized sample from the user's preferences. Our main result is an algorithm that samples high-weight entries from a low-rank approximation of the input matrix in time independent of m and n, given natural sampling assumptions on that input matrix. As a consequence, we show that Kerenidis and Prakash's quantum machine learning (QML) algorithm, one of the strongest candidates for provably exponential speedups in QML, does not in fact give an exponential speedup over classical algorithms.},

Tang, STOC'19], we introduce such a model, where we assume we can efficiently perform \$\textbackslash ell\^2\$-norm samples of input data, a natural analogue to quantum algorithms that assume efficient state preparation of classical data. Though this model produces less practical algorithms than the (stronger) standard model of classical computation, it captures versions of many of the features and nuances of quantum linear algebra algorithms. With this model, we describe classical analogues to Lloyd, Mohseni, and Rebentrost's quantum algorithms for principal component analysis [Nat. Phys. 10, 631 (2014)] and nearest-centroid clustering [arXiv:1307.0411]. Since they are only polynomially slower, these algorithms suggest that the exponential speedups of their quantum counterparts are simply an artifact of state preparation assumptions.},

  abstract = {Quantum many-body systems involving bosonic modes or gauge fields have infinite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces which must be truncated to perform simulations of real-time dynamics on classical or quantum computers. To analyze the truncation error, we develop methods for bounding the rate of growth of local quantum numbers such as the occupation number of a mode at a lattice site, or the electric field at a lattice link. Our approach applies to various models of bosons interacting with spins or fermions, and also to both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories. We show that if states in these models are truncated by imposing an upper limit \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ on each local quantum number, and if the initial state has low local quantum numbers, then an error at most \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ can be achieved by choosing \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ to scale polylogarithmically with \$\textbackslash epsilon\^\{-1\}\$, an exponential improvement over previous bounds based on energy conservation. For the Hubbard-Holstein model, we numerically compute a bound on \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ that achieves accuracy \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, obtaining significantly improved estimates in various parameter regimes. We also establish a criterion for truncating the Hamiltonian with a provable guarantee on the accuracy of time evolution. Building on that result, we formulate quantum algorithms for dynamical simulation of lattice gauge theories and of models with bosonic modes; the gate complexity depends almost linearly on spacetime volume in the former case, and almost quadratically on time in the latter case. We establish a lower bound showing that there are systems involving bosons for which this quadratic scaling with time cannot be improved. By applying our result on the truncation error in time evolution, we also prove that spectrally isolated energy eigenstates can be approximated with accuracy \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ by truncating local quantum numbers at \$\textbackslash Lambda=\textbackslash textrm\{polylog\}(\textbackslash epsilon\^\{-1\})\$.},

Quantum-state tomography (QST) aims at reconstructing the full quantum state from simple measurements, and therefore provides a key tool to obtain reliable analytics. Brute-force approaches to QST, however, demand resources growing exponentially with the number of constituents, making it unfeasible except for small systems. Here we show that machine learning techniques can be efficiently used for QST of highly-entangled states, in both one and two dimensions. Remarkably, the resulting approach allows one to reconstruct traditionally challenging many-body quantities - such as the entanglement entropy - from simple, experimentally accessible measurements. This approach can benefit existing and future generations of devices ranging from quantum computers to ultra-cold atom quantum simulators.},

We derive a new Lieb-Robinson bound for systems with interactions that decay with distance \$r\$ as a power law, \$1/r\^\textbackslash alpha\$. The bound implies an effective light cone tighter than all previous bounds. Our approach is based on a technique for approximating the time evolution of a system, which was first introduced as part of a quantum simulation algorithm by Haah et al., FOCS'18. To bound the error of the approximation, we use a known Lieb-Robinson bound that is weaker than the bound we establish. This result brings the analysis full circle, suggesting a deep connection between Lieb-Robinson bounds and digital quantum simulation. In addition to the new Lieb-Robinson bound, our analysis also gives an error bound for the Haah et al. quantum simulation algorithm when used to simulate power-law decaying interactions. In particular, we show that the gate count of the algorithm scales with the system size better than existing algorithms when \$\textbackslash alpha{$>$}3D\$ (where \$D\$ is the number of dimensions).},

A polynomial time solution to the sign problem is highly desired since it would provide an unbiased and numerically exact method to simulate correlated quantum systems. Here we show, that such a solution is almost certainly unattainable by proving that the sign problem is NP-hard, implying that a generic solution of the sign problem would also solve all problems in the complexity class NP (nondeterministic polynomial) in polynomial time.},

  abstract = {Quantum correlations between two parties are essential for the argument of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in favour of the incompleteness of quantum mechanics. Schr\textbackslash "odinger noted that an essential point is the fact that one party can influence the wave function of the other party by performing suitable measurements. He called this phenomenon quantum steering and studied its properties, but only in the last years this kind of quantum correlation attracted significant interest in quantum information theory. In this paper the theory of quantum steering is reviewed. First, the basic concepts of steering and local hidden state models are presented and their relation to entanglement and Bell nonlocality is explained. Then various criteria for characterizing steerability and structural results on the phenomenon are described. A detailed discussion is given on the connections between steering and incompatibility of quantum measurements. Finally, applications of steering in quantum information processing and further related topics are reviewed.},

  abstract = {Optimization is a major part of human effort. While being mathematical, optimization is also built into physics. For example, physics has the Principle of Least Action; the Principle of Minimum Power Dissipation, also called Minimum Entropy Generation; and the Variational Principle. Physics also has Physical Annealing, which, of course, preceded computational Simulated Annealing. Physics has the Adiabatic Principle, which, in its quantum form, is called Quantum Annealing. Thus, physical machines can solve the mathematical problem of optimization, including constraints. Binary constraints can be built into the physical optimization. In that case, the machines are digital in the same sense that a flip\textendash flop is digital. A wide variety of machines have had recent success at optimizing the Ising magnetic energy. We demonstrate in this paper that almost all those machines perform optimization according to the Principle of Minimum Power Dissipation as put forth by Onsager. Further, we show that this optimization is in fact equivalent to Lagrange multiplier optimization for constrained problems. We find that the physical gain coefficients that drive those systems actually play the role of the corresponding Lagrange multipliers.},

It is shown that there exist nine families of states corresponding to nine different ways of entangling four qubits. The states in the generic family give rise to GHZ-like entanglement. The other ones contain essentially 2- or 3-qubit entanglement distributed among the four parties. The concept of concurrence and 3-tangle is generalized to the case of mixed states of 4 qubits, giving rise to a seven parameter family of entanglement monotones. Finally, the SLOCC operations maximizing all these entanglement monotones are derived, yielding the optimal single copy distillation protocol.},

  abstract = {Quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature and involve the appearance of long-range correlations. These correlations are not due to thermal fluctuations but to the intricate structure of a strongly entangled ground state of the system. We present a microscopic computation of the scaling properties of the ground-state entanglement in several 1D spin chain models both near and at the quantum critical regimes. We quantify entanglement by using the entropy of the ground state when the system is traced down to \$L\$ spins. This entropy is seen to scale logarithmically with \$L\$, with a coefficient that corresponds to the central charge associated to the conformal theory that describes the universal properties of the quantum phase transition. Thus we show that entanglement, a key concept of quantum information science, obeys universal scaling laws as dictated by the representations of the conformal group and its classification motivated by string theory. This connection unveils a monotonicity law for ground-state entanglement along the renormalization group flow. We also identify a majorization rule possibly associated to conformal invariance and apply the present results to interpret the breakdown of density matrix renormalization group techniques near a critical point.},

The purpose of this review article is twofold. Firstly, we will give an overview of the most commonly used Quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. It will give enough background to understand the principles of these methods, their strengths and weaknesses. Secondly, the most important physical results for many-body problems in solid state physics, obtained by QMC simulations, will be presented.

Specifically, we consider quantum proofs for properties of black-box groups, which are finite groups whose elements are encoded as strings of a given length and whose group operations are performed by a group oracle. We prove that for an arbitrary group oracle there exist succinct (polynomial-length) quantum proofs for the Group Non-Membership problem that can be checked with small error in polynomial time on a quantum computer. Classically this is impossible--it is proved that there exists a group oracle relative to which this problem does not have succinct proofs that can be checked classically with bounded error in polynomial time (i.e., the problem is not in MA relative to the group oracle constructed). By considering a certain subproblem of the Group Non-Membership problem we obtain a simple proof that there exists an oracle relative to which BQP is not contained in MA. Finally, we show that quantum proofs for non-membership and classical proofs for various other group properties can be combined to yield succinct quantum proofs for other group properties not having succinct proofs in the classical setting, such as verifying that a number divides the order of a group and verifying that a group is not a simple group.},

While the evolution of a quantum state under a Hamiltonian is straightforward (if sometimes expensive), using quantum computers to determine the ground state phase diagram of a quantum model and the properties of its phases is more involved. Using the Hubbard model as a prototypical example, we here show all the steps necessary to determine its phase diagram and ground state properties on a quantum computer. In particular, we discuss strategies for efficiently determining and preparing the ground state of the Hubbard model starting from various mean-field states with broken symmetry. We present an efficient procedure to prepare arbitrary Slater determinants as initial states and present the complete set of quantum circuits needed to evolve from these to the ground state of the Hubbard model. We show that, using efficient nesting of the various terms each time step in the evolution can be performed with just \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N)\$ gates and \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash log N)\$ circuit depth. We give explicit circuits to measure arbitrary local observables and static and dynamic correlation functions, both in the time and frequency domain. We further present efficient non-destructive approaches to measurement that avoid the need to re-prepare the ground state after each measurement and that quadratically reduce the measurement error.},

  abstract = {The science of quantum information has arisen over the last two decades centered on the manipulation of individual quanta of information, known as quantum bits or qubits. Quantum computers, quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits, since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and channel discrimination. This review reports on the state of the art in this field, ranging from the basic theoretical tools and landmark experimental realizations to the most recent successful developments.},

  abstract = {One of the most widespread methods to determine if a quantum state is entangled, or to quantify its entanglement dimensionality, is by measuring its fidelity with respect to a pure state. In this Letter we find a large class of states whose entanglement cannot be detected in this manner; we call them unfaithful. We find that unfaithful states are ubiquitous in information theory. For small dimensions, we check numerically that most bipartite states are both entangled and unfaithful. Similarly, numerical searches in low dimensions show that most pure entangled states remain entangled but become unfaithful when a certain amount of white noise is added. We also find that faithfulness can be self-activated, i.e., there exist instances of unfaithful states whose tensor powers are faithful. To explore how the fidelity approach limits the quantification of entanglement dimensionality, we generalize the notion of an unfaithful state to that of a D-unfaithful state, one that cannot be certified as D-dimensionally entangled by measuring its fidelity with respect to a pure state. For describing such states, we additionally introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations that fully characterizes the set of states of Schmidt rank at most D.},

  abstract = {A formulation of numerical real-space renormalization groups for quantum many-body problems is presented and several algorithms utilizing this formulation are outlined. The methods are presented and demonstrated using S=1/2 and S=1 Heisenberg chains as test cases. The key idea of the formulation is that rather than keep the lowest-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in forming a new effective Hamiltonian of a block of sites, one should keep the most significant eigenstates of the block density matrix, obtained from diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of a larger section of the lattice which includes the block. This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S=1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10-9. The method can be applied to almost any one-dimensional quantum lattice system, and can provide a wide variety of static properties., This article appears in the following collection:}

The first three sections give a relatively short review of basic renormalization group ideas, mainly in the context of critical phenomena. The relationship of the modern renormalization group to the older problems of divergences in statistical mechanics and field theory and field theoretic renormalization is discussed in Sec. IV. In Sec.

The emphasis is on principles, not particular applications. Sections 1- 8 provide a self-contained introduction at a fairly elementary level to the statistical mechanical theory. No background is required except for some prior experience with diagrams. In particular, a diagrammatic approximation to an exact renormalization group equation is presented in sections 4 and 5; sections 6---8 include the approximate renormalization group recursion formula and the Feynman graph method for calculating exponents. Sections 10- 13 go deeper into renormalization group theory (section 9 presents a calculation of anomalous dimensions). The equivalence of quantum field theory and classical statistical mechanics near the critical point is established in section 10 ; sections 11- 13 concern problems common to both subjects. Specific field theoretic references assume some background in quantum field theory . An exact renormalization group equation is presented in section 11; sections 12 and 13 concern fundamental topological questions.}

Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5\textbackslash times \{\textbackslash bf S\}\^5\$ match with the chiral operators of \$\textbackslash N=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the \$\textbackslash N=4\$ theory has a large \$N\$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of \$AdS\$ black holes.},

Formal language theory is used to extend dynamical systems theory descriptions of cellular automata. The sets of configurations generated after a finite number of time steps of cellular automaton evolution are shown to form regular languages. Many examples are given. The sizes of the minimal grammars for these languages provide measures of the complexities of the sets. This complexity is usually found to be non-decreasing with time. The limit sets generated by some classes of cellular automata correspond to regular languages. For other classes of cellular automata they appear to correspond to more complicated languages. Many properties of these sets are then formally non-computable. It is suggested that such undecidability is common in these and other dynamical systems.},

We apply this real-valued lackadaisical quantum walk to two problems. First, we analyze it on the line or one-dimensional lattice, showing that it is exactly equivalent to a continuous deformation of the three-state Grover walk with faster ballistic dispersion. Second, we generalize Grover's algorithm, or search on the complete graph, to have a weighted self-loop at each vertex, yielding an improved success probability when \$l {$<$} 3 + 2\textbackslash sqrt\{2\} \textbackslash approx 5.828\$.},

However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of graph neural networks.

The possibility is explored of having invariance under local isotopic spin rotations. This leads to formulating a principle of isotopic gauge invariance and the existence of a b field which has the same relation to the isotopic spin that the electromagnetic field has to the electric charge. The b field satisfies nonlinear differential equations. The quanta of the b field are particles with spin unity, isotopic spin unity, and electric charge {$\pm$}e or zero.}

We extend quantum metrology beyond this standard setting and consider estimation of a physical process with quantum memory, here referred to as a parametrized quantum comb. We present a theoretic framework of metrology of quantum combs, and derive a general upper bound of the comb quantum Fisher information. The bound can be operationally interpreted as the quantum Fisher information of a memoryless quantum channel times a dimensional factor. We then show an example where the bound can be attained up to a factor of four. With the example and the bound, we show that memory in quantum sensors plays an even more crucial role in the estimation of combs than in the standard setting of quantum metrology.},

We show that for a fixed computation time, the optimal evolution has a bang-bang (square pulse) form, both for closed and open quantum systems with Markovian decoherence. Our findings support the choice of evolution ansatz in the recently proposed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Focusing on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass as an example, we find a system-size independent distribution of the duration of pulses, with characteristic time scale set by the inverse of the coupling constants in the Hamiltonian. The optimality of the bang-bang protocols and the characteristic time scale of the pulses provide an efficient parameterization of the protocol and inform the search for effective hybrid (classical and quantum) schemes for tackling combinatorial optimization problems. For the particular systems we study, we find numerically that the optimal nonadiabatic bang-bang protocols outperform conventional quantum annealing in the presence of weak white additive external noise and weak coupling to a thermal bath modeled with the Redfield master equation.},

For P1 and P2 to determine cooperatively the value f(i, j), they send information to each other alternately, one bit at a time, according to some algorithm. The quantity of interest, which measures the information exchange necessary for computing f, is the minimum number of bits exchanged in any algorithm.

  abstract = {The variational method is a versatile tool for classical simulation of a variety of quantum systems. Great efforts have recently been devoted to its extension to quantum computing for efficiently solving static many-body problems and simulating real and imaginary time dynamics. In this work, we first review the conventional variational principles, including the Rayleigh-Ritz method for solving static problems, and the Dirac and Frenkel variational principle, the McLachlan's variational principle, and the time-dependent variational principle, for simulating real time dynamics. We focus on the simulation of dynamics and discuss the connections of the three variational principles. Previous works mainly focus on the unitary evolution of pure states. In this work, we introduce variational quantum simulation of mixed states under general stochastic evolution. We show how the results can be reduced to the pure state case with a correction term that takes accounts of global phase alignment. For variational simulation of imaginary time evolution, we also extend it to the mixed state scenario and discuss variational Gibbs state preparation. We further elaborate on the design of ansatz that is compatible with post-selection measurement and the implementation of the generalised variational algorithms with quantum circuits. Our work completes the theory of variational quantum simulation of general real and imaginary time evolution and it is applicable to near-term quantum hardware.},

In contrast to the traditional approach of operating on fixed dimensional vectors, we consider objective functions defined on sets and are invariant to permutations. Such problems are widespread, ranging from the estimation of population statistics, to anomaly detection in piezometer data of embankment dams, to cosmology. Our main theorem characterizes the permutation invariant objective functions and provides a family of functions to which any permutation invariant objective function must belong. This family of functions has a special structure which enables us to design a deep network architecture that can operate on sets and which can be deployed on a variety of scenarios including both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on population statistic estimation, point cloud classification, set expansion, and outlier detection.}

The measured probability distributions and the position's second moment clearly show the non-classical character of the quantum walk. To further highlight the difference between the classical (random) and the quantum walk, we demonstrate the reversibility of the latter.

Recently, a large class of states whose entanglement can not be detected with the fidelity witness has been discovered in Phys.Rev.Lett \textbackslash textbf\{124\},200502(2020). They are called unfaithful states. In this paper we propose a new way to detect entanglement by calculating the lower bound of entanglement using measurement results. Numerical simulation shows our method can detect entanglement in unfaithful states with a small number of measurements. Moreover, we generalize our scheme to multipartite states and show that it can tolerate higher noise than previous entanglement witness operators with same number of measurement settings.},

First, the \$\textbackslash Omega(N\^\{1/3\})\$ lower bound only applies when the range is no larger than the domain, which precludes many of the cryptographically interesting applications. Second, most of the results in the literature only apply to \$r\$-to-1 functions, which are quite different from random functions. Understanding the collision problem for random functions is of great importance to cryptography, and we seek to fill the gaps of knowledge for this problem. To that end, we prove that, as expected, a quantum query complexity of \$\textbackslash Theta(N\^\{1/3\})\$ holds for all interesting domain and range sizes. Our proofs are simple, and combine existing techniques with several novel tricks to obtain the desired results. Using our techniques, we also give an optimal \$\textbackslash Omega(N\^\{1/3\})\$ lower bound for the set equality problem.

In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation framework of graph kernels is proposed for unattributed graph classification. According to the kernel design methods, the whole graph kernel family can be categorized in five different dimensions, and then several representative graph kernels are chosen from these categories to perform the evaluation. With plenty of real-world and synthetic datasets, kernels are compared by many criteria such as classification accuracy, F1 score, runtime cost, scalability and applicability. Finally, quantitative conclusions are discussed based on the analyses of the extensive experimental results. The main contribution of this paper is that a comprehensive evaluation framework of graph kernels is proposed, which is significant for graph-classification applications and the future kernel research.},

We compare the measurement strategies with uniform, biased, and derandomized classical shadows to conventional ones that sequentially measure each state function exploiting either importance sampling or observable grouping. We next demonstrate the estimation of nonlinear functions using classical shadows and analyze the entanglement of the prepared quantum state. Our experiment verifies the efficacy of exploiting (derandomized) classical shadows and sheds light on efficient quantum computing with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.},

  abstract = {A quantum simulator is a restricted class of quantum computer that controls the interactions between quantum bits in a way that can be mapped to certain difficult quantum many-body problems. As more control is exerted over larger numbers of qubits, the simulator can tackle a wider range of problems, with the ultimate limit being a universal quantum computer that can solve general classes of hard problems. We use a quantum simulator composed of up to 53 qubits to study a non-equilibrium phase transition in the transverse field Ising model of magnetism, in a regime where conventional statistical mechanics does not apply. The qubits are represented by trapped ion spins that can be prepared in a variety of initial pure states. We apply a global long-range Ising interaction with controllable strength and range, and measure each individual qubit with near 99\% efficiency. This allows the single-shot measurement of arbitrary many-body correlations for the direct probing of the dynamical phase transition and the uncovering of computationally intractable features that rely on the long-range interactions and high connectivity between the qubits.},

In this paper, we consider techniques to implement matrix functions on a quantum computer, which are composed of basic matrix operations on a set of matrices. These matrix operations include addition, multiplication, Kronecker sum, tensor product, Hadamard product, and single-matrix functions. We discuss the composed matrix functions in terms of the estimation of scalar quantities such as inner products, trace, determinant and Schatten p-norms. We thus provide a framework for compiling instructions for linear algebraic computations into gate sequences on actual quantum computers.},

  abstract = {The algorithmic error of digital quantum simulations is usually explored in terms of the spectral norm distance between the actual and ideal evolution operators. In practice, this worst-case error analysis may be unnecessarily pessimistic. To address this, we develop a theory of average-case performance of Hamiltonian simulation with random initial states. We relate the average-case error to the Frobenius norm of the multiplicative error and give upper bounds for the product formula (PF) and truncated Taylor series methods. As applications, we estimate average-case error for digital Hamiltonian simulation of general lattice Hamiltonians and \$k\$-local Hamiltonians. In particular, for the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain with \$n\$ spins, the error is quadratically reduced from \$\textbackslash mathcal O(n)\$ in the worst case to \$\textbackslash mathcal O(\textbackslash sqrt\{n\})\$ on average for both the PF method and the Taylor series method. Numerical evidence suggests that this theory accurately characterizes the average error for concrete models. We also apply our results to error analysis in the simulation of quantum scrambling.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Recently, there are tremendous developments on the number of controllable qubits in several quantum computing systems. For these implementations, it is crucial to determine the entanglement structure of the prepared multipartite quantum state as a basis for further information processing tasks. In reality, evaluation of a multipartite state is in general a very challenging task owing to the exponential increase of the Hilbert space with respect to the number of system components. In this work, we propose a systematic method using very few local measurements to detect multipartite entanglement structures based on the graph state\textemdash one of the most important classes of quantum states for quantum information processing. Thanks to the close connection between the Schmidt coefficient and quantum entropy in graph states, we develop a family of efficient witness operators to detect the entanglement between subsystems under any partitions and hence the entanglement intactness. We show that the number of local measurements equals to the chromatic number of the underlying graph, which is a constant number, independent of the number of qubits. In reality, the optimization problem involved in the witnesses can be challenging with large system size. For several widely used graph states, such as 1-D and 2-D cluster states and the Greenberger\textendash Horne\textendash Zeilinger state, by taking advantage of the area law of entanglement entropy, we derive analytical solutions for the witnesses, which only employ two local measurements. Our method offers a standard tool for entanglement-structure detection to benchmark multipartite quantum systems.},

  abstract = {Entanglement is an essential resource in many quantum information tasks and entanglement witness is a widely used tool for its detection. In experiments the prepared state generally deviates from the target state due to some noise. Normally the white noise model is applied to quantifying such derivation and in the same time reveals the robustness of the witness. However, there may exist other kind of noise, in which the coherent noise can dramatically "rotate" the prepared state. In this way, the coherent noise is likely to lead to a failure of the detection, even though the underlying state is actually entangled. In this work, we propose an efficient entanglement detection protocol for \$N\$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-like states. The protocol can eliminate the effect of the coherent noise and in the same time feedback the corresponding noise parameters, which are beneficial to further improvements on the experiment system. In particular, we consider two experiment-relevant coherent noise models, one is from the unconscious phase accumulation on \$N\$ qubits, the other is from the rotation on the control qubit. The protocol effectively realizes a family of entanglement witnesses by postprocessing the measurement results from \$N+2\$ local measurement settings, which only adds one more setting than the original witness specialized for the GHZ state. Moreover, by considering the trade-off between the detection efficiency and the white-noise robustness, we further reduce the number of local measurements to 3 without altering the performance on the coherent noise. Our protocol can enhance the entanglement detection under coherent noises and act as a benchmark for the state-of-the-art quantum devices.},

Ultracold atom in optical lattice is considered as one of the promising platforms due to its feasible initialization and parallel manipulation. In this work, we propose an efficient scheme to generate and characterize global entanglement in the optical lattice. With only two-layer quantum circuits, the generation utilizes two-qubit entangling gates based on the superexchange interaction in double wells. The parallelism of these operations enables the generation to be fast and scalable. To verify the entanglement of this non-stabilizer state, we mainly design three complementary detection protocols which are less resource-consuming compared to the full tomography. In particular, one just needs two homogenous local measurement settings to identify the entanglement property. Our entanglement generation and verification protocols provide the foundation for the further quantum information processing in optical lattice.},

  abstract = {A universal family of Hamiltonians can be used to simulate any local Hamiltonian by encoding its full spectrum as the low-energy subspace of a Hamiltonian from the family. Many spin-lattice model Hamiltonians -- such as Heisenberg or XY interaction on the 2D square lattice -- are known to be universal. However, the known encodings can be very inefficient, requiring interaction energy that scales exponentially with system size if the original Hamiltonian has higher-dimensional, long-range, or even all-to-all interactions. In this work, we provide an efficient construction by which these universal families are in fact "strongly" universal. This means that the required interaction energy and all other resources in the 2D simulator scale polynomially in the size of the target Hamiltonian and precision parameters, regardless of the target's connectivity. This exponential improvement over previous constructions is achieved by combining the tools of quantum phase estimation algorithm and circuit-to-Hamiltonian transformation in a non-perturbative way that only incurs polynomial overhead. The simulator Hamiltonian also possess certain translation-invariance. Furthermore, we show that even 1D Hamiltonians with nearest-neighbor interaction of 8-dimensional particles on a line are strongly universal Hamiltonian simulators, although without any translation-invariance. Our results establish that analog quantum simulations of general systems can be made efficient, greatly increasing their potential as applications for near-future quantum technologies.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are a powerful tool for the characterization of quantum states. Existing networks are typically trained with experimental data gathered from the specific quantum state that needs to be characterized. But is it possible to train a neural network offline and to make predictions about quantum states other than the ones used for the training? Here we introduce a model of network that can be trained with classically simulated data from a fiducial set of states and measurements, and can later be used to characterize quantum states that share structural similarities with the states in the fiducial set. With little guidance of quantum physics, the network builds its own data-driven representation of quantum states, and then uses it to predict the outcome statistics of quantum measurements that have not been performed yet. The state representation produced by the network can also be used for tasks beyond the prediction of outcome statistics, including clustering of quantum states and identification of different phases of matter. Our network model provides a flexible approach that can be applied to online learning scenarios, where predictions must be generated as soon as experimental data become available, and to blind learning scenarios where the learner has only access to an encrypted description of the quantum hardware.},

An SVM allows for the construction of a hyperplane that clearly delineates between separable states and the target entangled state; this hyperplane is a weighted sum of observables (`features') whose coefficients are optimized during the training of the SVM. In contrast to other methods such as deep neural networks, the training of an SVM is a convex optimization problem and always yields an `optimal' solution. We demonstrate with this method the ability to obtain witnesses that require only local measurements even when the target state is a non-stabilizer state. Furthermore, we show that SVMs are flexible enough to allow us to rank features, and to reduce the number of features systematically while bounding the inference error. This programmatic approach will allow us to streamline the detection of entangled states in experiment.},

  abstract = {"Introduced as a quantum extension of Maxwell's classical theory, quantum electrodynamics has been the first example of a quantum field theory (QFT). Eventually, QFT has become the framework for the discussion of all fundamental interactions at the microscopic scale except, possibly, gravity. More surprisingly, it has also provided a framework for the understanding of second order phase transitions in statistical mechanics. In fact, as hopefully this work illustrates, QFT is the natural framework for the discussion of most systems involving an infinite number of degrees of freedom with local couplings. These systems range from cold Bose gases at the condensation temperature (about ten nanokelvin) to conventional phase transitions (from a few degrees to several hundred) and high energy particle physics up to a TeV, altogether more than twenty orders of magnitude in the energy scale. Therefore, although excellent textbooks about QFT had already been published, I thought, many years ago, that it might not be completely worthless to present a work in which the strong formal relations between particle physics and the theory of critical phenomena are systematically emphasized. This option explains some of the choices made in the presentation. A formulation in terms of field integrals has been adopted to study the properties of QFT. The language of partition and correlation functions has been used throughout, even in applications of QFT to particle physics. Renormalization and renormalization group properties are systematically discussed. The notion of effective field theory and the emergence of renormalisable theories are described. The consequences for fine tuning and triviality issue are emphasized. This fifth edition has been updated and fully revised"--},

  abstract = {Can high energy physics be simulated by low-energy, non-relativistic, many-body systems, such as ultracold atoms? Such ultracold atomic systems lack the type of symmetries and dynamical properties of high energy physics models: in particular, they manifest neither local gauge invariance nor Lorentz invariance, which are crucial properties of the quantum field theories which are the building blocks of the standard model of elementary particles. However, it turns out, surprisingly, that there are ways to configure atomic system to manifest both local gauge invariance and Lorentz invariance. In particular, local gauge invariance can arise either as an effective, low energy, symmetry, or as an "exact" symmetry, following from the conservation laws in atomic interactions. Hence, one could hope that such quantum simulators may lead to new type of (table-top) experiments, that shall be used to study various QCD phenomena, as the confinement of dynamical quarks, phase transitions, and other effects, which are inaccessible using the currently known computational methods. In this report, we review the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories, and then describe our recent progress in constructing quantum simulation of Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},
