@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="Informally, quantum state tomography refers to the task of estimating complete description (density matrix) of an unknown $D$-dimensional state $\rho $ within error tolerence $\epsilon $, given the ability to prepare and measure copies of $\rho $."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="Intermediate between independent measurements and unrestricted (also called “collective” or “entangled”) measurements are adaptive measurements in which the copies of $\rho $ are measured individually, but the choice of measurement basis can change in response to earlier measurements."}
